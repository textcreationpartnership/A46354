            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <seg rend="decorInit">A</seg>Lthough I know before hand how the pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fixing of your Name upon this account will be reſented by your Ladyſhip, yet I am by ſo many Reaſons thereunto oblig'd that I muſt venture to do it, and caſt my ſelf upon your Goodneſs for my pardon. This <hi>Volume</hi> of <hi>Sermons</hi> (which is but a Forerunner to <hi>Two</hi> or <hi>Three</hi> more) I preſume therefore humbly to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dicate to your Honour; which, though in it ſelf and in your Ladyſhips eſteem, it be a very inſignificative thing, yet however 'tis a declaration to the World that I am
<pb facs="tcp:43599:3"/>ſenſible of my vaſt obligations to You; and that I would catch at every thing wherein I might teſtifie how much I am beholden to you. And I hope you will not be offended with me for the doing of that, which all (who know my Circumſtances) would have wondred if I had omitted. Surely <hi>(Madam)</hi> thoſe extraordinary Favours which (for above Twenty Years) you have been pleas'd to confer upon me and mine, deſerve over and over all thoſe little expreſſions of humble Reſpect and Gratitude which I can poſſibly make: This Dedication therefore being deſign'd for thoſe Ends, I beſeech you that you will pleaſe to put a favourable interpretation upon it.</p>
            <p>But beſides this, your Ladyſhip may upon ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiderations claim a ſpecial intereſt in this Work, (if there be any thing of good either in it or by it); One of which I ſhall not conceal, the reſt I muſt. When I had finiſh'd my Preaching on <hi>the Chapter</hi> which I have gone over, You was pleas'd to deſire me (and your De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires are, and ought to be, Commands to me), to publiſh to the World what I had done in a private Auditory: which deſire of Yours (in concurrence with my own hopes of doing ſome good), did very much prevail with me to engage in this difficult and painful Undertaking, (which was before as much beſides my intention as againſt my inclination). So that <hi>(Madam)</hi> you are in a ſpecial manner to be own'd in what is here done; and (the truth is) if any benefit ſhall thereby accrue to any, it muſt (under God) upon ſeveral accounts in a great meaſure be aſcribed to your Honour, you having been ſo inſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mental in the promoting thereof.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Madam,</hi> that which once was preached to your Ear is now preſented to your Eye: and it is my hope (and ſhall be my prayer) that thoſe heavenly Truths, which in the Hearing of them were not unto you (as well as others) without ſome conſiderable efficacy and ſweetneſs, may
<pb facs="tcp:43599:3"/>not in the Reading of them be unto you leſs efficacious and ſweet. The <hi>Chapter</hi> opened is a <hi>Summary</hi> of Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical <hi>Duty</hi> and <hi>Comfort;</hi> through the rich Grace of God you are (in a very eminent manner) a performer of the One, and through the ſame Grace of God you are alſo a partaker of the Other; and ſhall (I truſt) grow up daily yet more and more to an higher partici<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pation of it. I cannot wiſh you to be more <hi>holy</hi> than to do what is here enjoyned, nor more <hi>happy</hi> than to poſſeſs what is here promiſed.</p>
            <p>It pleaſes the Merciful God (the ſoveraign diſpoſer of Life and Death, in whoſe hands Yours and all our times are), as yet to continue you in the land of the living: When many, very many of your dear Relations are taken away and <hi>are not,</hi> you your Self are yet ſpared (with a ſmall number of Survivors). I beſeech you give me leave (if you do not give it me I muſt take it), to pray for the long continuance of this mercy, that your days may ſtill be prolonged on earth, and that you may arrive at a far greater Age than what as yet you have arrived at. You are impatient (I fear a little too much) to be gone; partly from the dread you have of the infirmities which attend old age, and your wearineſs of the world; and partly from the pantings of your Soul to be with Chriſt and in the poſſeſſing of the heavenly Glory. But (good Madam) I beſeech you not too much haſte, no not for Heaven it-ſelf; you'l have it never the ſooner for that. He that hath determin'd your Days and Months, and hath allotted you ſuch Work to do in your Genera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, will have you (let your own thoughts and de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſires be what they will) live out that time, and finiſh that work which he hath ſet you: be entreated there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore quietly and chearfully <hi>to wait all the days of your appointed time till your change ſhall come.</hi> Heaven will
<pb facs="tcp:43599:4"/>be the ſame twenty years hence that now it is; and the longer you are kept out of it, upon the doing of Gods work, the better it will be to you at laſt. <hi>'Tis one of the highest degrees of grace that here a Saint is capable of, to be ſure of Heaven and yet, in order to ſervice, to be willing for a time to be kept out of Heaven;</hi> here was the<note n="*" place="margin">

Nevertheleſs, to abide in the fleſh is more needful for you. And having this confidence, I know that I ſhall abide and continue with you all, for your furtherance and joy of faith.</hi> 'Tis a Saying of<note n="*" place="margin">Ingentis ani<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mi eſt alienâ causâ ad vitam reverti.</note> 
               <hi>Seneca, It argues a great and generous mind for one to be willing for the ſake of another to return to life again;</hi> ſurely that Chriſtian diſcovers true greatneſs of Spirit, who for the good of Others is willing to continue in this Life and to be kept out of that which is far better. <hi>Madam,</hi> your Serviceableneſs is known to all but to your Self; many have cauſe to bleſs God for the good which they reap by your means, (who can ſpeak that which 'tis not convenient for me to write): it will be a rare piece of Self-denyal, for you to ſubmit (as to your own perſonal intereſt) to be a loſer if others may be gainers thereby. Aſſure your ſelf, many do earneſtly beg of God the prolongation of your Days; You pray for your Death but they for your Life, I hope in this God will hear them and not you. Your gracious Father hath given you a title to Heaven, hath (in a great mea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure) fitted you for Heaven, and will in due time take you up into Heaven: it being thus, as to the ordering of your paſſage thither and the timing of your entrance into it, all that (good Madam) you ſhould wholly re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fer to his good pleaſure.</p>

               <hi>Madam,</hi> The Dedication of Book (I very well know) ſignifies but little to your Ladyſhip, <hi>Prayer</hi> is the thing which you deſire and value; wherein ſhould I be wanting (it being the only requital I can make you for all your Favours) I ſhould certainly be unworthy and ingrateful beyond all expreſſions. As God ſhall enable me, according to the many obligations which I lie under I ſhall never ceaſe to pray for <hi>You</hi> and <hi>Yours.</hi> If hath pleaſed the ſoveraign and all-diſpoſing God to cut off many <hi>Branches</hi> which grew from your <hi>Stock,</hi> yet One (and the principal One too) is hitherto ſpared; God grant he may be ſo long, and that all Heavenly Bleſſings as well as Earthly may be multiplied upon him. And bleſſed be the Lord you live to ſee Others who are of You (though not immediately yet but at one remove), whom God begins to bleſs with an hopeful Iſſue; the beſt of his Bleſſings be upon them alſo! That Honou<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rable Family (to which you are ſo nearly related) when ſo many Great and Ancient Families are melted away like Snow before the Sun, yet keeps up in its priſtine Greatneſs and Splendor; and may it ſo continue from ge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neration to generation till the World ſhall be no more! And for your Self <hi>(Madam)</hi> the God of Heaven bleſs you, and recompence into your boſome ſevenfold all that kindneſs that ever you have ſhown to any of his: He grant that you may <hi>bring forth fruit in your old age and be fat and flouriſhing;</hi> that you may <hi>come to your grave in a full age like as a ſhock of corn cometh in its ſeaſon;</hi> that as your <hi>outward man decays your inward man may be renewed day by day;</hi> that you may never want <hi>the light of his countenance;</hi> that you may at the laſt arrive at that <hi>Peace, Comfort, Aſſurance</hi> which you have ſo long been praying for; that you may yet be a <hi>ſhining light</hi> in that more publick <hi>Orb</hi> wherein you are fix'd, a <hi>pat<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tern</hi> of Humility and Condeſcenſion, of all Graces and
<pb facs="tcp:43599:5"/>Vertues and good Works to all who behold you; and (finally) that when you have <hi>fought the good fight,</hi> and ſhall have <hi>finiſhed your courſe,</hi> and <hi>kept the faith,</hi> you may receive <hi>that crown of righteouſneſs, which the Lord the righteous Judge ſhall give you at that day.</hi> Theſe are, have been, and ever ſhall be the daily and ardent Prayers of</p>

            <p>§ 2.

No ſooner was I come to this reſolu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, but immediately it pleaſed God to bring to my thoughts the <hi>Eighth Chapter</hi> to the <hi>Romans:</hi> which when I had a little ſurvay'd in my mind and taken a ſhort view of the <hi>fulneſs</hi> and <hi>preciouſneſs</hi> of its <hi>matter,</hi> without any further demur or heſitancy I reſolved alſo that that ſhould be the Chapter which I would lay out my pains upon. Accordingly I entred upon it; and (for which I heartily bleſs the Lord) he who directed me to that Undertaking was gra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ciouſly pleaſed to aſſiſt me in it and to carry me through it.</p>
            <p>§ 3. The <hi>Excellency</hi> of this <hi>Chapter</hi> being my great inducement to pitch upon it, it would have been requiſite that I ſhould here have
<pb facs="tcp:43599:6"/>endeavoured to have ſet forth that excellency, had I not in my firſt entrance upon the work it ſelf ſaid enough upon that account. To <hi>compare Scripture with Scripture</hi> (that one place may give light to another) is a thing very ſafe and good, but to <hi>compare Scripture before Scripture</hi> is a thing that muſt be done with much tenderneſs and caution: I adore every part and parcel of Sacred Writ (<note n="*" place="margin">2 Tim. 3.16.</note> 
               <hi>all</hi> being <hi>given by inſpiration of God</hi> and admirably uſeful to that end for which it was appointed), and would be very careful how I prefer one before another. Therefore I do not ſay that <hi>Pauls Epiſtles</hi> are the moſt excellent of all the <hi>New Teſtament</hi> Writings, or that this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> to the <hi>Romans</hi> is the moſt excellent of all the other Epiſtles, or that this <hi>Chapter</hi> therein is the moſt excellent of all the other Chapters (in which <hi>gradation</hi> ſome pleaſe themſelves): Yet this I may ſafely ſay, that this <hi>Epiſtle</hi> and this <hi>Chapter</hi> for <hi>ſublimity</hi> of <hi>Matter, variety</hi> of <hi>Evangelical Truths,</hi> admirable <hi>Support</hi> and <hi>Comfort</hi> to <hi>Believers,</hi> are not inferiour to any part whatſoever of the Holy Scriptures. Which if ſo, I have then pitch'd upon a Subject very well worthy of my beſt Endeavours, and none will blame me for attempting to open ſo rich a Cabinet.</p>
            <p>§ 4. In digging into this <hi>Mine</hi> I found it to be ſo full that it was a long time before I could get to the bottom of it; for I was two years (and ſomething more) in preaching over this Chapter. In which time I preached very many Sermons upon it, but the preciſe Number I will not mention; becauſe Some from thence might take occaſion to faſten that cenſure upon me which I hope I do not deſerve; and Others ſeeing here but <hi>Eighteen</hi> of ſo many publiſhed, might think I ſhall never come to the end of all. Well! though the work was long yet it pleaſed God to ſpare me till I had finiſhed it: I have now entred upon a work of another nature, whether he will alſo let me ſee the finiſhing of that, <gap reason="foreign">

            <p>§ 5. Wherein it fares with me much as it ſometimes doth with Sea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>men; who after a long and tedious Voyage are no ſooner arriv'd at ſhore, but preſently they are ſeiz'd upon and ſent to Sea again, upon a Voyage far more tedious and dangerous than the former: This is my caſe, when I had but juſt ſet my foot on land and was got off from one Service which was enough painful and troubleſome, by the over-ruling Providence of God I was commanded to Sea again, and put upon another Service far more difficult and dangerous than the former. But I muſt be at his diſpoſe who may command me whither and about what he pleaſes! and it becomes me with all alacrity to go whitherſoever he bids me go, and to do whatſoever he bids me do.</p>

§ 6. When I had finiſhed my <hi>Sermons</hi> on the <hi>whole Chapter,</hi> ſeve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral Friends importun'd me to print them: whoſe importunity though I could not well withſtand, yet ſurely had there been nothing more than that, I had not been drawn thereby to undertake ſuch a task as I now have. And the truth is, when I conſider my great averſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs to Printing, the vaſtneſs and difficulty of the preſent Work, my great unfitneſs for it (as upon other accounts ſo in reſpect of my bodily infirmities which daily grow upon me), my ſluggiſh, melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly temper, the many divertiſements I meet with by other employments; I ſay when I conſider theſe things I cannot but ſtand and wonder how I came to be thus engag'd. I muſt (upon the whole matter) reſolve it mainly into the overpow'ring, all-determining Will of God, and conclude he had appointed and cut out this Work for me and would have me do it. I write not this (I can ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peal to the Searcher of hearts) to heighten my fitneſs for this ſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vice or the worth of any thing that I have done; but only that I may declare the true Ground of my engaging in the preſent buſi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs, duly acknowledge God in ſuch an enterpriſe as this is, and alſo that I may animate my Faith and Hope in Him for Aſſitance and Succeſs; as knowing that what he calls unto he will carry through and what is of him ſhall be bleſſed by him.</p>
            <p>§ 7. As ſoon as my <hi>Preaching-work</hi> was off of my hands, after a very ſhort reſpit I ſet upon this of <hi>Printing:</hi> wherein what pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greſs I have made, this <hi>Volume</hi> (which I publiſh as a <hi>prodromus</hi> to what is yet to come) will manifeſt. It contains what I preach'd upon the <hi>four firſt Verſes.</hi> Some (I aſſure my ſelf) will be ſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>priz'd, and think it ſtrange that ſo few Verſes ſhould make a Volume of this bulk and bigneſs: but I would deſire theſe before they judge to caſt their eye upon the <hi>various Heads</hi> diſcuſſed therein, to weigh the great <hi>latitude</hi> and <hi>importance</hi> of thoſe Heads; and I hope they will then be ſatisfied that in the due handling of ſo many and ſo material things leſs could not well be ſpoken. I did indeed deſign at firſt to have gone much farther, but afterwards I ſaw (the work growing ſo much upon me) theſe <hi>Verſes</hi> were as much as I could graſp in one Book. And the Apoſtle ending with them the <hi>firſt part</hi> of his Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>courſe, (<hi>viz</hi> the <hi>confirmation</hi> of the <hi>Predicate</hi> in the <hi>Propoſition, there is no condemnation, &amp;c.</hi>) I thought without any unhandſome disjoining of the Words I might there break off. What comes after in the following Verſes, wherein there is the illuſtration of the <hi>Subject,</hi> who <hi>walk not after the fleſh, &amp;c.</hi> ſhall next be inſiſted upon (if God per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mit).</p>

§ 8. When I ſay that what I <hi>preach'd</hi> is here <hi>publiſhed,</hi> I would not be miſunderſtood; as if I had not varied in the <hi>Latter</hi> from the <hi>Former:</hi> for I acknowledge I have varied very much; and that too not only in <hi>Words</hi> and <hi>Expreſſions</hi> but (in ſeveral places) even in the very <hi>Method</hi> and <hi>Matter.</hi> Which alterations proceeded not only from my infelicity (that I cannot twice do the ſame thing in the ſame way); but alſo becauſe I found, upon the review of what I had done, <hi>Second thoughts</hi> to be neceſſary. Add to this too, there muſt be a difference when we have to do with the <hi>Ear</hi> and when with the <hi>Eye;</hi> for that <hi>Style</hi> and <hi>Method,</hi> yea and <hi>Matter</hi> too, which is proper for the one is not always ſo for the other. I hope therefore none will be ſevere againſt me becauſe of theſe Variations; but if any will be ſo, let them be ſure that they them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves do wear but the ſame cloaths abroad which they do at home, (which I think few do).</p>
            <p>§ 9. The <hi>Matter</hi> in the <hi>Firſt</hi> and <hi>Second Verſes</hi> being (compara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively) more plain and practical, in going over them I have (to the beſt of my remembrance) varied but little: but in the <hi>Third</hi> and <hi>Fourth Verſes</hi> where the Matter is more deep and <hi>Controverſal,</hi> there I have varied much more. They point me to Chriſts <hi>Natural Sonſhip, Incarnation, Sacrifice</hi> for ſin, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> which excellent <hi>Heads</hi> I did not paſs over in Preaching without ſome conſiderable enlarge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment upon them; but had I then ſo fully handled them as here I do, I ſhould but have tir'd and perplex'd the generality of private Au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ditors, and ſcarce have edified them. Indeed theſe are Points (eſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cially if largely and throughly diſcuſs'd) much more proper for a <hi>Reader,</hi> whoſe thoughts may dwell upon them he having them fixed before him; than for an <hi>Hearer,</hi> who through the conſtant ſucceſſion of new matter, the ſlowneſs of underſtanding, the weak<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of memory, is not ſo able to take them in or to judge a-right of them. Upon this Conſideration I have here added and inſerted many things which then I omitted; hoping that as what I then ſpake was not too little for Hearers, ſo that what I now write will not be too much for Readers.</p>
            <p>§ 10. Reader, I hope in the peruſal of this Book thou wilt find, that things of a <hi>practical nature,</hi> ſuch as concern <hi>Faith, holy Wal<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king,</hi> deliverance from <hi>Sins dominion</hi> (and the like), have far the greateſt room in it: yet I am not aſham'd to own that there are in it ſeveral things of another nature (I mean <hi>Controverſial</hi>); which I neither could nor (in truth) did deſire to avoid. As to Controverſies more nice and curious than neceſſary and profitable, none delights
<pb facs="tcp:43599:7"/>in them leſs than my ſelf; (who would love to walk in the midſt' of briars and thorns that hath pleaſant meadows or gardens to walk in?) much leſs d<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">
                  <desc>•</desc>
               </gap> I delight to trouble weak Chriſtians with knotty and <hi>polemick</hi> matters. But the <hi>Controverſies</hi> which I handle are of ſuch weight and importance, unto which too the <hi>Texts</hi> I open did ſo unavoidably lead me, that I knew not (without falſhood to my Truſt as a Miniſter of the Goſpel) how to ſhun them. Shall the <hi>Natures, Offices, Sonſhip, Incarnation, Sacriſice, &amp;c.</hi> of our deareſt Lord and Saviour be aſſaulted by daring Enemies, and ſhall not we (eſpecially when they lie in our way) defend and vindicate them? And are theſe the great things upon which the Salvation and Happineſs of Believers do depend, and ſhall not they under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand how <hi>Adverſaries</hi> attempt to undermine them? yea, ſo to be able to anſwer ſuch Gainſayers as that they may ſtand firm and fixed upon theſe Goſpel Foundations? That I might therefore heighten the knowledge and confirm the Faith of ſuch, I have been ſomewhat large upon theſe things; in the managing whereof if I have done too much for the Unlearned and too little for the Learned, I am ſorry for it.</p>
            <p>§ 11. Of all the Controverſies with which the Church is peſtred, I have (as the <hi>Texts</hi> did lead me) moſt concerned my ſelf in thoſe wherein we have to do with <hi>Papiſts</hi> and <hi>Socinians;</hi> but principally with the <hi>Latter.</hi> Theſe (not that I in other things acquit the <hi>Former</hi>) are the great impugners of the Chriſtian Faith, in their denying Chriſts <hi>Godhead, eternal Sonſhip, Pre-exiſtence</hi> before his Nativity of the <hi>Virgin</hi> (wherein they are worſe than the old <hi>Arrians</hi>), <hi>Satis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction,</hi> his being a proper <hi>Sacrifice for Sin,</hi> the <hi>main Ends</hi> of his <hi>Death, &amp;c.</hi> Againſt whom therefore I have endeavoured to aſſert and maintain theſe high and glorious Truths (which are indeed Truths of the firſt magnitude). What thoughts others may have of <hi>Socinianiſm</hi> I know not, I know my own: And might I preſume ſo far as to give advice to my <hi>Reverend Brethren in the Miniſtry,</hi> I would humbly adviſe them to ſet themſelves to their utmoſt againſt it. For it doth not only ſtrike at the whole platform of the Goſpel, but (of all other Opinions) it gets neareſt to the very Vitals thereof: this curſed worm grows in the Goſpels beſt fruit; 'tis for the poy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoning of thoſe Fountains from which the ſtreams of Life do moſt immediately flow; whilſt many other Errours endanger but the remoter parts, this endangers the very heart of Chriſtianity: can we ſay or do too much to ſecure Souls from it and to defend the Goſpel againſt it? God prevent the growth of it in all the Churches of Chriſt!</p>

§ 12. If in the diſcuſſing of theſe <hi>Points</hi> I have ſaid nothing but what the Learned in their <hi>Treatiſes</hi> about them have ſaid before, yet however <hi>two</hi> things I have done:
<list>
                  <item>(1.) According to my duty I have given my Teſtimony to the great Truths of God, (let it ſignifie what he pleaſes).</item>
                  <item>(2.) I hope I have (I am ſure it hath been my endeavour) made ſome things (in themſelves dark and intricate) to be ſomewhat more plain and intelligible to weaker Capacities: and if I have done but that, though I have brought no <hi>new matter,</hi> my pains have not been ill ſpent. My Souls deſire is that the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſors of this Age may be well grounded in the <hi>Articles</hi> of the <hi>Chriſtian Faith,</hi> and that they may attain to a clearer inſight into Goſpel Myſteries than what as yet they have attained to: and if what is here done ſhall conduce to the promoting of theſe moſt de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſirable things, it will be a ſufficient recompence to me for all the labour that I have been at.</item>
               </list>
            </p>
            <p>§ 13. I obſerve that many private Chriſtians will read over thoſe <hi>Controverſies</hi> in a <hi>Sermon,</hi> which they care not to read in <hi>Treatiſes</hi> profeſſedly penn'd about them: the Reaſon of which (I ſuppoſe) is this, they meet with that in a <hi>Sermon</hi> which they do not in a <hi>Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſe; viz.</hi> when the Argumentative part is over they come to ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing that is practical; the bone being broken they have marrow and ſweetneſs to feed upon. It hath been my care all along in this work to anſwer herein the expectation and deſire of good Souls, for at the cloſe of every knotty Subject I have always made thereof ſome plain and uſeful <hi>Application;</hi> that ſo I might reach both the Head and the Heart too.</p>
            <p>§ 14. So long as the ſtrife lay between an <hi>Iſraelite</hi> and an <hi>Egyptian</hi> the matter was not very ſad, but when the <hi>Iſraelite</hi> and the <hi>Iſraelite</hi> ſtrove one againſt the other then 'twas ſad indeed: So here; ſo long as the contention was 'twixt <hi>Romaniſts</hi> and <hi>Socinians</hi> on one hand and <hi>Proteſtants</hi> on the other, 'twas well enought; but when <hi>Prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtants</hi> divide and differ among themſelves, that's matter of great ſadneſs. In the Body of this Work I have had occaſion only to contend with the <hi>Former,</hi> and there I had nothing but comfort; but in the End I was neceſſitated to take notice of and to intereſt my ſelf in a difference between the <hi>Latter</hi> (concerning the <hi>imputation of Chriſts Active Obedience,</hi> which<note n="*" place="margin">Amongſt whom in its proper place (had not my memory fail'd me) I ſhould have cited that truly eminent Perſon Biſhop <hi>Reynolds</hi> on <hi>Pſal. 110. pag. 440.</hi> &amp;c.</note> ſome are for and ſome againſt), and that afflicted me more than all that went before. For though in my own judgment I am very well ſatisfied for the <hi>Affirmative,</hi> yet it troubles me that I ſhould therein diſſent from thoſe whoſe Names (as to the dead) I highly honour, and whoſe Perſons (as
<pb facs="tcp:43599:8"/>to the living) I dearly love. Well! theſe differences will be till Heaven unite us all: and bleſſed be God in this point we may differ <hi>ſalvo Fidei fundamento.</hi> I hope we ſhall make it to appear to the world that we can <hi>diſſent</hi> and yet <hi>love;</hi> that <hi>whereunto we have at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tained we ſhall walk by the ſame rule,</hi> and if <hi>in any thing we be otherwiſe minded, God ſhall reveal even this unto us,</hi> (according to that excellent deciſion of the Apoſtle in caſes of this nature).</p>
            <p>§ 15. But (Reader) I muſt not detain thee longer in giving thee any further account of the <hi>Particulars</hi> treated of in theſe <hi>Sermons;</hi> do but thy ſelf read over the <hi>Contents</hi> of the ſeveral <hi>Chapters,</hi> and they will in ſhort give thee a proſpect of the <hi>Matter</hi> and <hi>Method</hi> of the whole. Thou ſeeſt already a great part of my Way hither<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to hath been ſomewhat rough and craggy, I hope in what follows it will be more ſmooth and eaſie (bating thoſe paſſages which ſome <hi>Expoſitors</hi> conceive <hi>Peter</hi> referr'd unto, when he ſpake of <hi>ſome things in</hi> Pauls <hi>Epiſtles hard to be underſtood</hi>); however I muſt take it as it falls.</p>
            <p>§ 16. Two things as (to the whole) will be objected againſt me: the One is <hi>over much prolivity.</hi> As to which all that I can ſay for my ſelf is
<list>
                  <item>(1.) The <hi>Subjects</hi> inſiſted upon are ſo various, lying ſo near the very heart of Religion, bearing ſo high a place in Evan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gelical Faith, ſo neceſſary to be underſtood by all, and ſo deſpe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rately ſtruck at by <hi>Oppoſers;</hi> that truly for my part I thought (par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>don me if I was miſtaſten) I could hardly be too full in the <hi>Expli<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cation, Confirmation</hi> and <hi>Application</hi> of them. Good Reader! pleaſe to read over the bare <hi>Heads</hi> I go upon (as they will occur by and by), and then tell me whether <hi>ſo many</hi> and <hi>ſuch fundamental Truths</hi> could well have been crowded into a leſſer room. But</item>
                  <item>(2.) if this will not ſatisfie ſuch as are moſt judicious, it ſhall be mended in what is to follow.</item>

            <p>§ 17. The Other is, the <hi>unneceſſarineſs</hi> of this Undertaking ſo many already having wrote upon this Chapter. <hi>Anſw.</hi> So many? who or where are thoſe ſo many? I wiſh I could ſee them: I deny not but that many, both <hi>Ancients</hi> and <hi>Moderns,</hi> have written <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentaries</hi> upon it for the clearing up of the Senſe of the Words, (for whoſe labours I bleſs God, and ſhall in this Work endeavour to make the beſt improvement of them); but having done that, there they leave off: I hope I go further than ſo, not ſatisfying my ſelf barely to give the <hi>Senſe</hi> and <hi>Meaning</hi> of the <hi>Text</hi> (which is the proper work of an <hi>Expoſitor</hi>), but alſo drawing out that Senſe and making the beſt advantage of it for things <hi>Doctrinal</hi> and <hi>Practi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cal,</hi>
               <pb facs="tcp:43599:9"/>(which is the work of a <hi>Preacher</hi>).

Yea further I am not without ſome diſcouragement as to my external condition; the Sun (as to bodily Health, and ſome other Conſiderations) is going off from me, (few plants are ſo ſituated as to have the Fore-noon and After-noon Sun too); but that doth not quite diſcourage me neither.

            <p>§ 20. I muſt not be too bold with God in entitling him to what I do, yet I would fain hope that 'tis by his ſpecial Providence that I am engaged in this Undertaking; wherein I ſhould be exceedingly confirmed, might I ſee theſe <hi>Firſt Fruits</hi> (now publiſhed) owned and bleſſed by him to the profit of many; and with what chearful<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs ſhould I go on if I might in my firſt ſetting out have ſuch en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement! Till I be able about this to paſs a better judgment than as yet I can, it will be beſt for me for ſome little time to ſtay my hand (which accordingly I reſolve upon). I am very loth to burthen the world with unprofitable Labours; may I do good, all that I ſhall do will be too little; but without that, that which I have already done is too much. Well!

                  <note place="margin">The Diviſion of it into its Parts.</note> 
                  <hi>Divines</hi> (who write upon it) commonly divide it into <hi>Three Parts:</hi> The <hi>Firſt</hi> contains in it excellent ſupports and comforts for the people of God; <hi>as burdened under the reliques and remainders of Sin;</hi> (and this reaches from the 1 <hi>v. to the</hi> 17). The <hi>Second</hi> contains in it further ſupports and comforts in reference to the <hi>Sufferings, Afflicti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> which here are incident to the Godly; (this reaches from the 17 <hi>v. to the</hi> 31). The <hi>Third</hi> contains in it thoſe <hi>high and holy Triumphs</hi> which the Apoſtle (in his own perſon and in the per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon of all Believers) makes over both <hi>Sin and Suffering;</hi> (which reaches from the 31 <hi>v. to the end</hi>). In this <hi>threefold channel</hi> the Comforts of the whole Chapter run: (this Diviſion of it I ſhall follow, and accordingly divide my enſuing Diſcourſe into <hi>Three Parts.</hi>)</p>
               <p>For the <hi>Firſt (the ſupporting and comforting the Saints as bur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dened under the reliques of ſin),</hi> the Apoſtle begins with that, becauſe he very well knew that ſin (to ſuch) is their greateſt burden. O nothing lies ſo ſad and heavy upon their Spirits as this! It was ſo with <hi>Paul</hi> himſelf (as you ſee <hi>Chapt.</hi> 7.) and it is ſo too with all that are gracious (they having the ſame Spirit which he had). All <hi>Pauls afflictions without,</hi> (though they were very many and very ſharp, ſee his Catalogue of them 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.23. <hi>&amp;c.</hi>), were nothing to his <hi>Corruptions within:</hi> the former never made him cry out<note n="*" place="margin">Rom. 7.24.</note> 
                  <hi>O wretched man that I am</hi> as the latter did! O <hi>this Sin</hi> went to the heart of him and almoſt overwhelmed him! And ſo (proportionably) it is with all who belong to God. For this reaſon therefore, when the Apoſtle would comfort himſelf and others, he firſt applies his Diſcourſe to that which might give eaſe as to what was and is moſt burdenſome.</p>
               <p>In order to which, he Firſt <hi>lays down a notable Faith-ſupporting and Soul-reviving Propoſition:</hi>
                  <note place="margin">The main Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition.</note> then Secondly <hi>he amplifies and enlarges upon that Propoſition,</hi> (which he doth chiefly with reſpect to the <hi>deſcription</hi> of the <hi>Subject</hi> of it). And all that is contain'd in this <hi>Firſt Part</hi> of the Chapter will fall either under the one or the other of theſe <hi>two Heads.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>The <hi>Propoſition</hi> it ſelf is this, <hi>There is therefore now no Condemnation

No Condemnation to them which are in Chriſt Jeſus?</hi> O great and bleſſed words! How <hi>appoſitely, fully,</hi> and <hi>convincingly</hi> doth <hi>Paul</hi> ſpeak to the thing in hand! What a <hi>Baſis</hi> and Foundation doth he here lay for Faith to build upon! Is the gracious heart burd'ned under the remainders of Sin? what could be ſpoken more <hi>proper,</hi> more <hi>effectual</hi> for its relief, then to aſſure it that (though there may be <hi>much Corruption</hi> yet) there is <hi>no Condemnation?</hi> No Condemnation to them which are in Chriſt? what a <hi>magnificent Concluſion,</hi> what a <hi>Faith-ſtrengthening</hi> and <hi>heart-chearing</hi> conſideration is this! Here's <hi>Dainties</hi> and <hi>Cordials</hi> at the <hi>very firſt;</hi> no ſooner doth the Apoſtle <hi>launch</hi> out, but immediately he is in the <hi>great deeps</hi> of the Grace of God and of the happineſs of Believers.</p>

                  <hi>mans judgment;</hi> the righteous God judges otherwiſe of his people.

'Twas <hi>Davids</hi> Prayer to God <hi>Let my ſentence come forth from thy preſence, Pſal.</hi> 17.2. <hi>(q. d.)</hi> Lord! man doth thus and thus paſs ſentence upon my perſon, cauſe, actions; but Lord do thou thy ſelf paſs ſentence upon me, that I am ſure will be as <hi>juſt</hi> and <hi>righteous</hi> as the ſentence of my enemies is <hi>falſe</hi> and <hi>malicious;</hi> and do not <hi>keep</hi> thy Sentence about me <hi>to thy ſelf,</hi> but let it <hi>come forth from thy preſence</hi> that the world may ſee and know what I am, and what thoughts thou haſt of me.

And truly a condemning Conſcience is a very dreadful thing! be they Saints or Sinners who lie under it they will all find it to be bad enough; 'tis a <hi>little Hell</hi> or an <hi>anticipation</hi> of Hell; there's no pain in the body comparable to the torment of a condemning Conſcience; a man had better be <hi>condemned of all the World than of his own Conſcience.</hi> Yet the people of God have this to comfort them, though Conſcience <hi>condemns below</hi> yet God doth not <hi>condemn above:</hi> To the wicked, 'tis a condemning Conſcience and a condemning God too, (O there's the very height of miſery)! to the Godly, 'tis ſometimes a condemning Conſcience but never a con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning God; even when that ſpeaks nothing but Guilt and wrath then God deſigns nothing but Grace and mercy.

To obviate this diſcouragement, (ſaith the Apoſtle) I tell you there is no Condemnation to any who are in Chriſt (let them be who they will); this belongs to all ſuch, to you as well as to my ſelf. True, I am an <hi>Apoſtle</hi> you are not ſo, but then I am a <hi>Believer</hi> and ſo are you: true, I may have more of grace than you, but yet you are in Chriſt as well as I, and the <hi>

               <p>The difference in <hi>Pauls</hi> expreſſing himſelf (according to the diffe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rence of the ſubject he was upon) is very obſervable: take him in the <hi>former Chapter</hi> where he is bewailing ſin, there he ſpeaks altogether in the <hi>Firſt perſon Singular,</hi> and goes no further than himſelf; (read from the 7 <hi>verſe</hi> to the <hi>end</hi> and you'll find <hi>I</hi> and <hi>me</hi> in <hi>every verſe</hi>): But now in this <hi>Eighth Chapter</hi> where he's treating of <hi>Pri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viledges,</hi> there he ſpeaks altogether in the <hi>Plural number</hi> (as taking in the whole body of Believers).

Some enquire why the Apoſtle expreſſeth it in the <hi>Negative</hi> rather than in the <hi>Poſitive?</hi> they anſwer, becauſe Men (generally) are more ſenſible of the Goodneſs of God, in the freeing of them from evil than in the collating or beſtowing of good: <hi>No Condemnation</hi> more affects than <hi>poſitive Juſtification</hi> or <hi>Salvation.</hi> It may be further added, the Apoſtle thus expreſſes it becauſe <hi>Ne<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gatives uſually intend and highten the thing ſpoken of:</hi> as in the <hi>Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mandements,</hi> ſuch as are <hi>Negative</hi> carry an higher obligation in them than thoſe which are <hi>Poſitive,</hi> (for they oblige both <hi>ſemper</hi> and <hi>ad

Only (for the further confirming of the Truth in hand) let me a little deſcant upon the <hi>Queſtion</hi> which the Apoſtle here doth ſo triumphantly propound, <hi>Who is he that condemneth?</hi> He ſeems to challenge all <hi>inferiour Accuſers,</hi> and bid them do their worſt; he hangs out a <hi>Flag</hi> of <hi>Defiance</hi> to all; who (ſaith he) will attempt, or (in caſe they ſhould attempt) would be able to carry on ſuch a thing as the condemning of thoſe who are in Chriſt? For God himſelf (who muſt be ſpoken of with all reverence) <hi>he will not,</hi> for he juſtifies, and he cannot juſtifie and condemn too; his juſtice is ſatiſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, he hath declared that he hath accepted of Chriſts ſatisfaction made in the ſinners ſtead; and he will not be <hi>ſatisfied</hi> and <hi>yet condemn.</hi> Then (to be ſure) <hi>Chriſt will not,</hi> for his great deſign was to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vent and keep off this Condemnation; this was the very thing which he had in his eye in his great and moſt bleſſed undertaking; he's ſo far from doing this himſelf, that he will not ſuffer it to be done by any
<pb n="25" facs="tcp:43599:24"/>other. Come to <hi>ſin,</hi> that <hi>ſhall not;</hi> for that is pardoned, expiated by the blood of Chriſt; that is <hi>condemned</hi> it ſelf (<hi>Rom.</hi> 8.3), and a <hi>condemned thing</hi> ſhall never be a <hi>condemning thing. The Law cannot,</hi> for that is <hi>fulfilled</hi> by the <hi>Surety,</hi> and that is appealed from as not a <hi>proper judge,</hi> and Believers are <hi>not under it</hi> (<hi>i. e.</hi> as to its <hi>vis dam<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>natrix</hi>) <hi>but under Grace.

                  <note place="margin">
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion with Chriſt a great Myſtery.</note> becauſe this <hi>

<pb n="44" facs="tcp:43599:36"/>All believe it, but few underſtand it; all grant the <hi>quod ſit,</hi> but for the <hi>quid ſit</hi> how much are the moſt knowing perſons in the dark about it! The Apoſtle ſpeaking of it calls it a <hi>great myſtery, Eph.</hi> 5.32. and <hi>Col.</hi> 1.27. he ſets it forth <hi>by the riches of the glory of this myſtery</hi> (what's that? why) <hi>Chriſt in you the hope of glory.</hi> Indeed 'tis ſuch a <hi>myſtery,</hi> as that we ſhall never fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtand it till we come to Heaven, (where all myſteries ſhall be un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>folded, and particularly this of the <hi>myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi>). <hi>Joh.</hi> 14.20. <hi>At [that day] ye ſhall know that I am in my Father, and you in me, and I in you: that day</hi> refers either to the time <hi>when the Spirit ſhould be given,</hi> (which is promiſed <hi>v.</hi> 16, 17), or to the <hi>gloriſied ſtate</hi> (ſpoken of <hi>v.</hi> 19): upon the effuſion of the Spirit men may come to know ſomething of this Union, but it will never be fully under<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtood by them, till they be in Glory.

Briefly, upon this <hi>Law-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> reſulting from Chriſts <hi>Suretiſhip,</hi> our <hi>Sins</hi> were very well <hi>imputable</hi> to <hi>him</hi> and his <hi>merits</hi> to <hi>us.</hi> This doth ſo exactly fall in with the <hi>common notion</hi> and <hi>caſe</hi> of <hi>Suretyſhip</hi> amongſt Men, that I need not any further inſiſt upon the illuſtration of it. The <hi>Adverſaries</hi> therefore (who deny that Chriſt either did or could ſuffer in the Sinners ſtead, or that there is any imputation of his Merit to Believers), are ſo pinched with this, <hi>his being a Surety,</hi> that they oppoſe it to their utmoſt, wholly deny that too, and are feign to make good one denial with ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther. (But here I digreſs)!</p>
               <p>Two things I ſhall add upon <hi>this Head,</hi> and then diſmiſs it.</p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. That <hi>the Oneneſs of Perſon 'twixt Chriſt and the Saints</hi> (which
<pb n="51" facs="tcp:43599:39"/>hath been affirmed of them more than once or twice, in the opening of the matter in hand), is not to be carried further <hi>than that par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular Senſe and reſpect in which 'tis affirmed.</hi> I mean this, They are not <hi>one Perſon</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Nature, Eſſence,</hi> or any <hi>perſonal <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion;</hi> onely they <hi>are ſo</hi> in reſpect of that <hi>Myſtical</hi> and <hi>Legal One<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs</hi> of <hi>Perſon</hi> that is betwixt them. And this <hi>latter Oneneſs</hi> is very well conſiſtent with the <hi>different Natures</hi> of the <hi>Subjects united,</hi> though the <hi>former</hi> is not ſo.</item>
                  <item>2. That <hi>this Law-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion is only proper to Chriſt the Second Perſon.</hi> The <hi>myſtical</hi> and the <hi>moral</hi> Union (in ſome ſenſe) doth reach to the <hi>other Perſons;</hi> for though the Saints <hi>proximately</hi> and <hi>immediately</hi> are united to <hi>Chriſt;</hi> yet the Union is not ſo <hi>terminated</hi> in him, but that <hi>through</hi> him they are united to the <hi>Father</hi> too. Therefore 'tis ſaid <hi>Joh.</hi> 17.21. <hi>That they alſo may be one [in us];</hi> ('tis not one in <hi>Me</hi> ſingly, but one in <hi>

                     </note> that Believers (in ſome reſpects) <hi>are in both,</hi> and united both to <hi>Father</hi> and <hi>Son:</hi> But as to the <hi>Law-union</hi> (ariſing from <hi>Suretyſhip</hi> and <hi>Vadimony</hi>), that is only proper to Chriſt, he of all the Perſons being the <hi>alone Surety</hi> for Believers.</item>
               </list>
               <p>Thirdly, <hi>There is a Moral <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion between Chriſt and Believers:</hi> 'Tis called <hi>Moral</hi> from the <hi>Bond</hi> or <hi>Ground</hi> of it, which is <hi>Love;</hi> and the word [Moral] is us'd, not as it ſtands in contradiſtinction to <hi>Spiritual</hi> but to <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Phyſical<g ref="char:punc">▪</g>
                  </hi> I ſay, the Bond of this Union is <hi>Love,</hi> for <hi>Faith</hi> unites <hi>myſtically</hi> and <hi>Love</hi> unites <hi>morally.</hi> Love is an <hi>uniting grace</hi> as well as Faith though it doth not unite in the ſame way: therefore 'tis ſaid, <hi>He that dwelleth in Love, dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leth in God, and God in him,</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 4.16. 'Tis all <hi>for union,</hi> and it <hi>produces</hi> union: take two perſons who love each other, their mutual affection makes them to be <hi>One;</hi> there is a <hi>real Oneneſs</hi> between Friend and Friend. The <hi>Philoſopher</hi> very well defined <hi>Friendſhip</hi> by <hi>One Soul in two Bodies,</hi> (<gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap>, <hi>alteridem, another Self.</hi> Thus 'tis in that which is before us; there is a <hi>mutual, reciprocal, hearty</hi> Love between Chriſt and Believers, he loves them and they love him; and by vertue of this <hi>mutual Love</hi> there is a <hi>real</hi> and <hi>cloſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> betwixt them. The Husband and Wife are <hi>One,</hi> not meerly upon the <hi>Marriage Covenant</hi> and <hi>external Relation,</hi> but alſo (and chiefly) upon that <hi>Love</hi> and <hi>Affection</hi> that is betwixt them: So it is 'twixt Chriſt and Saints.<note n="*" place="margin">Qui ſcilicet dilect à Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto viciſſim Chriſtum a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mant: Hoce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nim eſt in Chriſto eſſe, non tantum Chriſto amari, ſed &amp; Chri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtum amare. <hi>Corn Muſſus.</hi>—Qui Cori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſto incorporati ſunt puro &amp; perfecto amo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>re. <hi>Idem.</hi>
                  </note> Some therefore open this <hi>being in Chriſt Jeſus</hi>
                  <pb n="52" facs="tcp:43599:40"/>(or Oneneſs with him) by Love; in reſpect of this <hi>Love</hi> Believers are <hi>in Chriſt.</hi> And ſo I have opened that <hi>threefold <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> which is between Chriſt and Believers. I have a little inſiſted upon the <hi>two latter branches</hi> of it, but 'tis the <hi>firſt</hi> (the <hi>Myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi>) that I ſhall further mainly ſpeak to; for the truth is, this is <hi>the <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> which the Goſpel principally ſets before us.</p>

                  <note place="margin">Scripture-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances by which the My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion is ſet forth.</note>The Second Thing propounded, was to inſtance in thoſe <hi>ſeveral Scripture-reſemblances by which the Myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion is ſet forth.</hi> Theſe are very many: For this being a very <hi>high</hi> and <hi>myſterious</hi> thing, it hath pleaſed God to make uſe of <hi>various Reſemblances</hi> for the better deſcribing of it; that he might thereby make it to us <hi>more credible</hi> and <hi>more intelligible.</hi> And 'tis obſervable, how the Spirit of God ſummons in <hi>all <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nions (Natural, Relative, Artiſicial),</hi> that he might by all of them more clearly and diſtinctly <hi>ſhadow</hi> out the <hi>grand <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> betwixt Chriſt and Saints. Yet I muſt tell you, though thoſe are very uſeful as to the <hi>End</hi> deſigned, and are very <hi>high</hi> (the <hi>higheſt</hi>) <hi>in genere <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nionis;</hi> yet they all come ſhort of the Myſtical Union which they refer to: they may <hi>illuſtrate</hi> it but they cannot <hi>reach</hi> or <hi>equalize</hi> it. I will but briefly go over them, both becauſe they are fully handled by Others, and alſo becauſe that which is proper from them to the buſineſs in hand, may be diſpatched in few words.</p>
               <p>The <hi>Firſt</hi> is that of <hi>Husband and Wife:</hi> A very fit and full <hi>Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance</hi> (a<note n="*" place="margin">See Dr. <hi>Cud<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>worths</hi> Union of Chriſt and the Church ſhadowed.</note> 
                  <hi>Type</hi> ſay ſome) of the <hi>Myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi> Upon the <hi>conjugal relation</hi> there is a very <hi>near</hi> and cloſe <hi>conjunction:</hi> If you pleaſe to look to, its <hi>firſt inſtitution,</hi> you will find a <hi>deep foundation</hi> of <hi>Oneneſs</hi> laid therein: <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.23, 24. <hi>This is now bone of my bone, and fleſh of my fleſh; therefore ſhall a man leave his father, and his mother, and ſhall cleave unto his wife, and they ſhall be one fleſh.</hi> Now Chriſt and Believers ſtand in this <hi>Conjugal relation</hi> each to the other: he is their <hi>Husband,</hi> they his <hi>Spouſe;</hi> they are <hi>eſpouſed to Chriſt their Husband</hi> 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 11.2. <hi>married to Chriſt Rom.</hi> 7.4. <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>trothed</hi> to God and Chriſt <hi>Hoſ.</hi> 2.19. their name is <hi>Hephzibah</hi> and <hi>Beulah Iſa</hi> 62.4. The <hi>Marriage-<g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> (in the very <hi>height</hi> of it) the Apoſtle brings down to Chriſt and Believers <hi>Eph.</hi> 5.28, 29, <hi>&amp;c. So ought men to love their wives as their own bodies: he that loveth his wife loveth himſelf. For no man ever yet hated his own fleſh: but nouriſheth it, and cheriſheth it, even as the Lord the Church. For we are members of his body, of his fleſh and of his bones. For this cauſe ſhall a man leave his father and his mother, and ſhall be joyned to his wife, and they two ſhall be one fleſh.</hi> Well, what of all this? (he
<pb n="53" facs="tcp:43599:40"/>adds), <hi>This is a great Myſtery, but I ſpeak concerning Chriſt and the Church:</hi> As if the Apoſtle had ſaid, do not miſapprehend me, though I ſpeak ſo much of the <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> that is betwixt <hi>Husband</hi> and <hi>Wife,</hi> according to the <hi>primitive Inſtitution,</hi> yet that is not the <hi>main thing</hi> which I drive at; I aim at an <hi>higher <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> than that, namely at that <hi>Spiritual <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> which is between <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Church.</hi> The Husband and the Wife are <hi>one,</hi> Chriſt and Believers are <hi>ſo much more.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Another <hi>Reſemblance</hi> is that of the <hi>Head</hi> and <hi>Members:</hi> In the <hi>Body Natural</hi> there is a <hi>near</hi> and <hi>cloſe <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> between theſe <hi>two;</hi> being faſtened and joyned each to the other they make up <hi>one</hi> and the <hi>ſame</hi> body. Thus 'tis with Chriſt and Believers in the <hi>Body My<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtical;</hi> he is the <hi>Head,</hi> they are the ſeveral <hi>Members</hi> belonging to that <hi>head; Col.</hi> 1.18. <hi>He is the Head of the body the Church: Eph.</hi> 1.22. <hi>God gave him to be the head over all things to the Church, which is his body:</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 12.27. <hi>Now ye are the body of Chriſt, and members in particular:</hi> (So <hi>Rom.</hi> 12.5). As truly and as nearly as the <hi>head</hi> and the <hi>members,</hi> ſo truly and ſo nearly are <hi>Chriſt</hi> and <hi>Believers</hi> united alſo.</p>
               <p>A <hi>third Reſemblance</hi> is that of the <hi>Root</hi> and <hi>Branches:</hi> There is alſo union betwixt theſe; otherwiſe how ſhould the <hi>One</hi> convey <hi>juice, ſap, nouriſhment, life, growth,</hi> to the <hi>Other?</hi> So 'tis with Chriſt and Believers; he is the <hi>Root,</hi> they the <hi>Branches: Joh.</hi> 15.5. <hi>I am the vine, ye are the branches.</hi> You read of being <hi>planted and in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grafted into Chriſt;</hi> 'tis a <hi>Metaphor</hi> which the Spirit of God much delights in, in the ſetting forth of that which I am upon: See <hi>Rom</hi> 6.5. and <hi>chap.</hi> 11.17. <hi>&amp;c.</hi> Alſo you read of being <hi>rooted in Chriſt, Col.</hi> 2.7. There is a bleſſed <hi>Analogy</hi> or reſemblance be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tween Chriſt and Believers and the Root and the Branches, in point of <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> in point of <hi>Influence:</hi> The <hi>root</hi> is united to the <hi>branches</hi> and <hi>th<gap reason="illegible" resp="#PDCC" extent="1 letter">

                     </gap>y</hi> to <hi>it;</hi> ſo is Chriſt to Believers and they to him: The <hi>root</hi> conveys <hi>life,</hi> and <hi>nouriſhment,</hi> and <hi>growth</hi> to the <hi>branches;</hi> ſo does Chriſt to Believers.</p>
               <p>Another <hi>Reſemblance</hi> is the <hi>Foundation</hi> and the <hi>Building:</hi> Here is <hi>
                     <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> too; for in a Building all the Stones and Timber being joined and faſtned together upon the Foundation, make but one <hi>entire Structure:</hi> So 'tis here. Believers are <hi>Gods building,</hi> and Chriſt is the <hi>foundation</hi> in that building; <hi>Ye are Gods building</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.9. <hi>Other foundation can no man lay then that which is laid, which is Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> 1 <hi>Cor.</hi> 3.11. Therefore they are ſaid <hi>to be built upon the foundation of the Prophets and Apoſtles, Jeſus Chriſt himſelf being the chief corner ſtone, Eph.</hi> 2.20. As a man builds upon the foun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dation,
<pb n="54" facs="tcp:43599:41"/>and lays the ſtreſs of the whole building upon that; ſo take the true Chriſtian he <hi>builds</hi> upon <hi>Chriſt,</hi> all his <hi>Faith, Hope, Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fidence</hi> is <hi>built</hi> upon this <hi>ſure foundation,</hi> (as Chriſt is ſtiled <hi>Iſa</hi> 28.16. <hi>Behold I lay in Zion a ſure foundation</hi>): Hence alſo they are ſaid, <hi>As lively ſtones to be built up a ſpiritual houſe &amp;c.</hi> 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.5. Here's the Myſtical Union under <hi>this reſemblance</hi> alſo.</p>
               <p>Take but One more, that of <hi>Meat</hi> or <hi>Food:</hi> That which a man feeds upon and digeſts, it is <hi>incorporated</hi> and <hi>united</hi> with himſelf; it's turned into his own ſubſtance and made a <hi>part</hi> of himſelf: The Believing Soul by Faith <hi>feeds</hi> upon Chriſt, <hi>digeſts</hi> him, and turns him (as it were) into his own ſubſtance; ſo that Chriſt becomes <hi>one</hi> with him and he <hi>one</hi> with Chriſt. <hi>Joh.</hi> 6.55, 56. <hi>My fleſh is meat indeed, and my blood is drink indeed; he that eateth my fleſh, and drinketh my blood, dwelleth in me, and I in him.</hi> All this muſt be taken not in the <hi>literal</hi> but in the <hi>ſpiritual</hi> notion; the <hi>eating</hi> and <hi>drinking</hi> is <hi>believing,</hi> (ſo 'tis to be underſtood all along in that <hi>Chapter</hi>): Upon which believing the <hi>

               </p>
               <p>Thus I have (with great brevity) given you thoſe <hi>Scripture-Re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblances</hi> by which the <hi>Myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> is <hi>ſhadowed</hi> out: The handling of them in their utmoſt extent, is a Subject that would have admitted of great enlargement: but my buſineſs was but to ſpeak to that <hi>one thing</hi> from them which ſuits with the work in hand. In ſome of the <hi>preceding Heads</hi> I was in the <hi>great deeps;</hi> but <hi>in this,</hi> I have been in the <hi>ſhallows:</hi> there the <hi>Elephant</hi> might <hi>ſwim,</hi> here the <hi>Lamb</hi> may <hi>wade;</hi> there things were not ſo <hi>dark</hi> but here they are as <hi>clear:</hi> therefore I ſhall not need to make any further ſtay upon them.</p>

                  <hi>If any man hath not the Spirit of Chriſt, he is none of his;</hi> (that is) he is none of thoſe who are ſavingly united to him.

The thing to be known is our <hi>being in Chriſt;</hi> and how may that be known? thus, by <hi>our being New Creatures.</hi> The Apoſtle ſets it down <hi>indefinitely</hi> that he may reach every perſon, <hi>if [any] man be in Chriſt, &amp;c.</hi> This <hi>New Creature</hi> is one of the grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>teſt <hi>riddles</hi> of Chriſtianity to men that have it not: 'Tis that <hi>new creation which the Soul paſſes under in the work of Converſion;</hi> or <hi>that great and univerſal change which follows upon Converſion:</hi> a <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>verted</hi> man is a <hi>changed</hi> man, a quite other perſon than what he was before; he may ſay (with <hi>Auſtine</hi>) <hi>I am not I; all old things are paſs'd away, and all things are become new,</hi> (as it follows in the place alledged). Upon Converſion, underſtanding, judgment, thoughts, will, affections, Conſcience, heart, tongue, life, all is <hi>new:</hi> when the Sinner is turned from Sin to God, he hath <hi>new Principles</hi> from which he acts, <hi>new Ends</hi> for which he acts, <hi>new Guides and Rules</hi> by which he acts; is not here a wonderful change? Now are you acquainted with this <hi>New Creature?</hi> what do you find of it in your ſelves? it converns you to make ſure of it, for all is nothing without it:<note n="*" place="margin">Gal. 6.15.</note> 
                  <hi>In Chriſt Jeſus</hi> (and ſo in reference to the proof of <hi>being in Chriſt Jeſus</hi>) <hi>neither circumciſion availeth any thing, nor uncircumci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion, but a new Creature;</hi> O this is all in all! this muſt be the ſure and infallible witneſs of your Union with Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Therefore examine your ſelves about it: I beſeech you look back, compare your ſelves with your ſelves; hath any <hi>thorough change</hi> been wrought in you? are you not <hi>the ſame</hi> you ever were? juſt ſuch as you came into the world? Can any that hears me ſay, O (bleſſed be God!) 'tis not with me as it hath been: Time was when I was blind, as ignorant a Creature as any; but I hope now in ſome meaſure I am enlightened; God hath ſhined into me, and ſet up ſuch a Light in me that I ſee what I never ſaw before, and I ſee it in another manner than I did before. Time was when I could ſwear, curſe, be drunk, take Gods name in vain, profane Sabbaths, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> but I dare not now give way to ſuch impieties. Time was when Sin and I agreed very well; but now my heart riſes at it,<note n="*" place="margin">Pſal. 119.104.</note> 
                  <hi>I hate every falſe way.</hi> Time was when I had no love for Duty, I liv'd in the total omiſſion of it; but now I love Prayer, I love the Word, and all the Ordinances
<pb n="66" facs="tcp:43599:47"/>of Chriſt are precious to me. Time was when I was all for the world, my whole heart was taken up in it; but now<note n="*" place="margin">Phil. 3.8.</note> 
                  <hi>I count all but loſs that I may gain Chriſt,</hi> now <hi>None but Chriſt, none but Chriſt.</hi> Can any of you thus ſpeak? here's <hi>a change</hi> indeed; upon that the <hi>New Creature</hi> indeed, and upon that <hi>Being in Chriſt</hi> indeed.</p>
               <p>There's <hi>a double change</hi> which evermore accompanies the <hi>Myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi>
               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1. <hi>The State of the Perſon is changed.</hi> He, who before he was in Chriſt was a <hi>Child of wrath,</hi> is now, upon his being in Chriſt, an <hi>heir of Grace;</hi> he, that before the Union, was in a ſtate of <hi>Condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation,</hi> is now after the Union in a ſtate of <hi>Salvation.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>2. <hi>The Nature is changed:</hi> there's a <hi>new Nature,</hi> a <hi>new Soul</hi> (not <hi>phyſically</hi> yet <hi>morally</hi>) infus'd into the regenerate perſon; the<note n="*" place="margin">2 Pet. 1.4.</note> 
                     <hi>divine Nature</hi> it ſelf is now communicated to him: whereupon he doth not <hi>think, ſpeak,</hi> or <hi>act</hi> as he did before; he doth not <hi>love</hi> or <hi>live</hi> as before; he <hi>walks in newneſs of life</hi> (as 'tis <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4). This is <hi>the change</hi> which we are to make ſure of; for aſſuredly the Lord Jeſus will put none into his boſome or make them a part of himſelf, but firſt the New Creature ſhall paſs upon them, to prepare and make them fit for ſo near and ſo cloſe an Union. 'Tis not con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiſtent with his honour to take a Sinner juſt as he finds him, and with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out any more adoe to own him as a member of himſelf. There out any more adoe to own him as a member of himſelf. There cannot be <hi>a paſſage</hi>-from <hi>one Head</hi> to <hi>another,</hi> but there muſt be ſome <hi>not able alteration:</hi> Chriſt will not break off a <hi>branch</hi> from the <hi>firſt root</hi> and <hi>ingraft</hi> it into <hi>himſelf,</hi> but he will firſt alter the very nature and property of it. 'Tis not in the power of Creatures to change thoſe whom they take into Union with them: the Husband may take the Wife into his boſome, but he cannot change her Nature, temper, diſpoſition: As <hi>Bernard</hi> ſaith of <hi>Moſes; Aethiopiſſam-duxit, ſed non potuit Aethiopiſſae mutare colorem; he married an Aethiopian, but he could not alter her Aethiopian complexion;</hi> (much leſs could he alter her <hi>inward temper</hi>): But Chriſt <hi>can</hi> and <hi>doth</hi> thus work upon thoſe whom he takes into near Union and relation; if he joyns the <hi>black, ſwarthy</hi> Soul to himſelf, he puts a <hi>new complexion</hi> upon it, he makes it <hi>comely with his own comelineſs</hi> (as God promiſes <hi>Ezek.</hi> 16.14). So then by this you may know, whether you be <hi>truly, really, ſavingly</hi> in Chriſt, <hi>(viz)</hi> if you <hi>be new Creatures;</hi> without the <hi>new Creation</hi> there's <hi>no Myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion.</hi>

(for that's <hi>the crucifixion</hi> here ſpoken of.) Aſſure your Selves, Chriſt will not have a <hi>member in him</hi> to be under a <hi>foreign power;</hi> the <hi>Fleſh</hi> ſhall not be the <hi>Ruler</hi> where <hi>He</hi> is the <hi>Head;</hi> where he brings about the <hi>

               <p>My <hi>Text</hi> too ſpeaks of <hi>this Fleſh;</hi> and it tells you, that <hi>they who are in Chriſt Jeſus do not walk after the Fleſh, but after the Spirit. Paul</hi> here ſeems to riſe and to go on <hi>ſtep</hi> by <hi>ſtep:</hi> would you know <hi>who are exempted from Condemnation?</hi> he tells you, ſuch <hi>who are in Chriſt;</hi> would you further know <hi>who are in Chriſt?</hi> he tells you, <hi>ſuch who walk not, &amp;c.</hi> Here then is the <hi>Characteriſtical Note</hi> of all who are in Chriſt, they live not the <hi>fleſhly, carnal, ſenſual</hi> Life, but the <hi>ſpiritual, heavenly, holy</hi> Life. Sirs! what is <hi>your walking?</hi> 'tis the <hi>Converſation</hi> that muſt diſcover the <hi>

He that doth not thus do, he may <hi>ſay</hi> he <hi>abides in Chriſt,</hi> but he doth but <hi>ſay</hi> ſo, 'tis not ſo in truth and reality.</p>

Theſe <hi>Luſts</hi> (I ſay) are the moſt <hi>proper iſſue</hi> and the moſt <hi>genuine effects</hi> of the <hi>corrupt Nature</hi> in man: <hi>Rom.</hi> 7.8. <hi>Sin taking occaſion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of Concupiſcence</hi> (or Luſt). <hi>Eph.</hi> 4.22. <hi>That ye put off concerning your former converſation, the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful Luſts</hi> Obſerve how <hi>the Fleſh,</hi> the <hi>old man,</hi> the <hi>corrupt Nature,</hi> and <hi>Luſt</hi> or <hi>Luſts</hi> are uſually <hi>link'd</hi> and coupled together.</p>
               <p>To apply this now to <hi>the walking</hi> which I am upon. <hi>To walk after the Fleſh,</hi> 'tis <hi>to live and act as under the full power and ſtrength of unmortified Luſt:</hi> 'tis to <hi>indulge, gratifie, obey,</hi> and <hi>comply</hi> with the <hi>Fleſh</hi> as a <hi>luſting thing,</hi> or as it puts forth it ſelf <hi>in ſinful luſtings.</hi> The Apoſtle 2 <hi>Pet.</hi> 2.10. having ſpoken of <hi>walking after the Fleſh,</hi> immediately he inſtances in the <hi>gratifying</hi> of a <hi>particular Luſt,</hi> thereby ſhewing what that walking after the Fleſh is: <hi>But chiefly them that walk after the Fleſh [in the Luſt of uncleanneſs] &amp;c.</hi> On the other hand, <hi>Not to walk after the Fleſh,</hi> 'tis to <hi>keep Luſt under,</hi> to beat it down, to reſiſt it, not to give way to it (in what<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ever <hi>form</hi> or <hi>ſhape</hi> it may aſſault the Soul), to live in the <hi>daily morti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication</hi> of it, not to ſuffer ſuch <hi>helliſh fire</hi> to <hi>ſmother</hi> and <hi>burn</hi> in the Soul, to let it have no harbour or entertainment in the heart, but to thruſt it out <hi>with abhorrency and deteſtation, &amp;c.</hi> this is <hi>not to walk after the Fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But <hi>this Luſt</hi> being ſo <hi>near</hi> to the <hi>Fleſh,</hi> ſo <hi>connatural</hi> with it, that which <hi>iſſues</hi> from it even as <hi>heat</hi> and <hi>burning</hi> doth from the <hi>fire;</hi>
                  <pb n="102" facs="tcp:43599:65"/>and the <hi>walking</hi> or <hi>not walking</hi> after the <hi>Fleſh</hi> being ſo much to be meaſur'd by it; I will therefore give you ſome <hi>further explication</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>
                  <hi>Luſt</hi> in Scripture (as 'tis taken in a <hi>bad ſenſe,</hi> for the <hi>Spirit</hi> hath its <hi>luſtings</hi> as well as the <hi>Fleſh</hi>), ſometimes notes the <hi>habit,</hi> the <hi>root</hi> it ſelf <hi>(viz.)</hi> the <hi>depraved Nature;</hi> ſometimes the <hi>Act,</hi> that <hi>curſed fruit</hi> which grows upon the forenamed curſed root. The Apoſtle <hi>James</hi> ſpeaks of it as the <hi>Mother ſin</hi> (if I may ſo expreſs it); <hi>Jam.</hi> 1.4. <hi>Every man is tempted, when he is drawn away of his own Luſt, and enticed: then when Luſt hath conceived, it bringeth forth ſin, &amp;c. Paul</hi> ſpeaks of it as the <hi>Daughter-ſin; Rom.</hi> 7.8. <hi>Sin taking occaſion by the commandment, wrought in me all manner of concupiſcence</hi> (or Luſt): the <hi>One</hi> conſiders it as the <hi>fountain,</hi> the <hi>Other</hi> as the <hi>ſtream.</hi> In this <hi>latter Notion</hi> I am to open it: and ſo 'tis <hi>the bent and propen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion,</hi> the <hi>eager, ſierce, vehement deſire of the Soul after fleſhly Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects</hi> or <hi>ſenſual things.</hi> For <hi>Luſt</hi> (in its <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>primary</hi> ſenſe) mainly lies in the [<gap reason="foreign">
                     <desc>〈 in non-Latin alphabet 〉</desc>
                  </gap>] <hi>the deſiring</hi> or <hi>concupiſcible faculty:</hi> therefore <gap reason="foreign">

                  </gap> is the word by which it is ſet forth. The Soul of man is a <hi>deſiring, craving, thirſting thing,</hi> 'tis a very <hi>maſs</hi> of <hi>deſires:</hi> and there's <hi>no faculty</hi> more <hi>natural</hi> to it or wherein it puts forth it ſelf more <hi>vigorouſly,</hi> than the <hi>deſiring faculty.</hi> Now here's the <hi>principal ſeat</hi> of <hi>Luſt,</hi> and that which gives it its very <hi>being:</hi> when the Soul is <hi>earneſtly, vehemently, impetuouſly</hi> carried out after ſome <hi>ſenſual good,</hi> ſomething that will pleaſe the <hi>fleſhly part</hi> (if it will but do that let it be what it will); this is <hi>Luſt.</hi> I ſay, it re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fers principally to the <hi>deſires</hi> as inordinately ſet upon and drawn out after fleſhly things. Therefore the Apoſtle couples them toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, <hi>the Luſts of the Fleſh</hi> and <hi>the deſires of the Fleſh, Eph.</hi> 2.3. And the other Apoſtle ſpeaking of the <hi>inordinate deſire</hi> of worldly <hi>pleaſure</hi> and <hi>profit,</hi> he expreſſeth it by <hi>the Luſt of the fleſh,</hi> and the <hi>Luſt of the eyes;</hi> 1 <hi>Joh.</hi> 2.16. I know, if you conſider Luſt <hi>ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually</hi> and <hi>radically,</hi> there is more in it than this: for ſo <hi>'tis the bent and propenſion of the Soul to whatever is evil, and its averſation from whatever is good.</hi> But if you conſider it <hi>actually</hi> and <hi>particularly,</hi> ſo <hi>fleſhly</hi> and <hi>ſenſual deſires</hi> are the <hi>main</hi> and moſt <hi>proper acts</hi> of it.</p>
               <p>Here further, you muſt diſtinguiſh of <hi>Luſt</hi> or <hi>Luſts:</hi> Some are more <hi>rank</hi> and <hi>groſs,</hi> ſuch as lie in the <hi>ſenſitive</hi> and <hi>fleſhly</hi> part; Others are more <hi>reſin'd</hi> and <hi>ſecret,</hi> ſuch as lie in the <hi>upper part</hi> of the Soul, the <hi>Reaſon, Mind,</hi> and <hi>Will.</hi> You read 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 7.1. <hi>of the filthineſs of the Fleſh, and of the Spirit:</hi> where the Apoſtle deſcribes the <hi>Luſts</hi> of the <hi>lower faculties</hi> under <hi>the filthineſs of the Fleſh;</hi>

               </p>

               <p>Here alſo not to inſiſt upon the <hi>ſeveral ſignifications</hi> and ſenſes of the word <hi>Spirit,</hi> in <hi>this place</hi> it muſt be taken either <hi>Perſonally,</hi> for the Spirit of God, the <hi>third Perſon</hi> in the Sacred <hi>Trinity;</hi> or <hi>Ha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bitually,</hi> for <hi>Grace</hi> in us, the Divine Nature implanted in the Soul in the work of regeneration; or it muſt be underſtood of <hi>both.</hi> You find <hi>Grace</hi> in Scripture ſet forth <hi>by Spirit; Joh.</hi> 3.6, <hi>What is born of the Fleſh, is Fleſh, and what is born of the Spirit, is Spirit:</hi> (where the <hi>latter Spirit</hi> muſt be underſtood of the <hi>heavenly</hi> and <hi>renewed Nature</hi>). <hi>Jude</hi> 19. the Apoſtle ſpeaks of ſome who were <hi>ſenſual, having not the Spirit;</hi> which though it be chiefly to be underſtood <hi>of the Spirit of Grace</hi> (of which theſe perſons were deſtitute), yet it takes in the <hi>Grace of the Spirit</hi> too.

               <p n="3">III. <hi>To walk after the ſpirit,</hi> 'tis <hi>to have ſpiritual and heavenly Affections; ſuch as are proper to and ſuit with the Divine Spirit.</hi> The <hi>Spirit himſelf</hi> wherever he dwells, and the <hi>ſpiritual life</hi> wherever it is wrought in the Soul, are always attended with <hi>ſpiritual affections:</hi> and indeed much of the <hi>influence</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of <hi>both</hi> is exerted in the <hi>ſpiritualizing</hi> of the affections.

<pb n="110" facs="tcp:43599:69"/>after the ſpirit</hi> (or who walk after the ſpirit) <hi>mind the things of the ſpirit:</hi> This <hi>minding</hi> the things of the <hi>fleſh</hi> or of the <hi>ſpirit,</hi> is not to be limited either to the <hi>inward acts</hi> of the <hi>Mind</hi> in the <hi>thoughts</hi> onely, or to the <hi>outward endeavours;</hi> but it includes and takes in the <hi>affections</hi> alſo. Here then is the difference; Such as are <hi>after the fleſh,</hi> they <hi>mind (i. e.)</hi> they <hi>ſavour</hi> and <hi>reliſh</hi> the things of the fleſh; their affections are wholly ſet upon and drawn out after <hi>fleſhly Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects,</hi> their love, delight, deſires, run out altogether upon theſe things: But they that are <hi>after the ſpirit,</hi> they <hi>mind the things of the ſpirit;</hi> their <hi>affections</hi> are fixed upon <hi>ſpiritual Objects,</hi> they run in the right channel, are place upon God and Chriſt; they are (in a word) <hi>pure</hi> and <hi>heavenly.</hi> The <hi>fleſh</hi> hath <hi>carnal affections;</hi> and indeed it puts forth it ſelf very <hi>much</hi> (if not <hi>moſt</hi>) in them: therefore you have it coupled with them <hi>Gal.</hi> 5.24. <hi>They that are Chriſt's, have crucified the fleſh, with the [affections] and luſts.</hi> On the other hand the <hi>ſpirit</hi> hath its <hi>affections</hi> too, but they are as contrary to the for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mer as Heaven is to Hell. 'Pray obſerve what the Apoſtle ſubjoins (<hi>v.</hi> 25), <hi>If we live in the ſpirit, let us walk in the ſpirit.</hi> This <hi>walking in the ſpirit</hi> (for it will bear <hi>this ſenſe</hi> as well as <hi>that</hi> which I mentioned before), is brought in by way of <hi>oppoſition</hi> to the <hi>affecti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons</hi> and <hi>luſts</hi> of the <hi>fleſh;</hi> 'tis as if he had ſaid, <hi>if we live in the ſpirit</hi> then let us not give way to thoſe <hi>ſordid affections</hi> which are of the fleſh and ſuit with it; but let our <hi>affections</hi> be ſuch as may ſuit with the <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> and with that <hi>Divine Life</hi> which he hath wrought in us.

               </p>
               <p n="4">IV. <hi>To walk after the Spirit,</hi> 'tis <hi>to live under and to cloſe with ſecret inclinations and propenſions in the Soul to what is holy and good:</hi> ſo that the <hi>bent, byas, tendency,</hi> and <hi>workings</hi> of the heart are for what is <hi>good</hi> and againſt what is <hi>evil.</hi> Theſe <hi>two contrary principles</hi> have always <hi>contrary propenſions,</hi> they incline and draw contrary ways: the <hi>good Spirit</hi> and the <hi>ſanctified Nature</hi> are all for <hi>Obedience,</hi> cloſe walking with God, the exerciſe of the ſeveral Graces, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> there's <hi>their tendency;</hi> The <hi>evil Spirit without</hi> and the <hi>evil Nature within</hi> (I put them <hi>together,</hi> for they agree too well in that which I am upon), they are altogether for <hi>ſin;</hi> they perpetually <hi>incline</hi> and urge to <hi>pride, paſſion, envy, coveteouſneſs, uncleanneſs, &amp;c.</hi> there's <hi>their tendency.</hi> And theſe <hi>different propenſions</hi> are ſo far in the Saints themſelves, that they are the <hi>ground</hi> of that <hi>civil war</hi> and <hi>conflict</hi> which they in this Life feel ſo much of: They are ſet forth by the <hi>luſtings of the fleſh againſt the ſpirit,</hi> and <hi>of the ſpirit againſt the

               <p>Thus have I ſhown in theſe <hi>five particulars</hi> what it is to <hi>walk after the Spirit:</hi> Concerning which, 'tis not neceſſary that I ſhould vouch an <hi>exact difference</hi> betwixt them, I give them but as ſo <hi>many illuſtra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions</hi> of the <hi>Thing</hi> and ſo you muſt take them. From all that hath been ſpoken it appears, that this <hi>twofold walking</hi> is not to be limited to meer <hi>external</hi> and <hi>viſible acts</hi> in the <hi>life,</hi> but it lies very much in the <hi>inward, ſecret</hi> acts of the <hi>heart:</hi> there's the <hi>Principle,</hi> the <hi>Affections,</hi> the <hi>Propenſions,</hi> the <hi>Ends,</hi> and theſe are the things which do <hi>conſtitute</hi> the <hi>walking</hi> either <hi>fleſhly</hi> or <hi>ſpiritual:</hi> (but more of this in the <hi>

<list>
                     <item>1. <hi>'Tis the Spirit which unites to Chriſt:</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>2. This <hi>uniting Spirit</hi> is always an <hi>active,</hi> working <hi>Spirit:</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>3. The <hi>Matter</hi> of his <hi>working</hi> is <hi>Sanctification</hi> and <hi>univerſal Holineſs:</hi>
                     </item>
                     <item>4. The <hi>manner</hi> of his <hi>working</hi> is <hi>effectual</hi> and <hi>irreſiſtible.</hi>
                     </item>
                  </list> Now put all <hi>theſe conſiderations</hi> together, and it will moſt undeniably follow, that ſuch who are in Chriſt they ſhall walk not after the <hi>Fleſh</hi> but after the <hi>Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Moreover, 'tis the <hi>very Spirit of Chriſt himſelf</hi> by which Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers are united to him; ſo that the <hi>ſame Spirit</hi> which was <hi>in him</hi> is <hi>in them</hi> alſo (though in a <hi>different meaſure</hi>); now hereupon where there is the <hi>ſame ſpirit</hi> there will be the <hi>ſame courſe</hi> or <hi>walking:</hi> and therefore as Chriſt was holy ſo will they be holy too, and as Chriſt walked not after the fleſh but after the ſpirit, ſo will they walk alſo. If he indeed ſhould take a perſon and <hi>immediately</hi> make him one with himſelf, poſſibly the certainty of this <hi>ſpiritual walking</hi> would not be ſo evident: but the Union being carried on <hi>mediately</hi> by the
<pb n="114" facs="tcp:43599:71"/>
                  <hi>Holy Spirit,</hi> that Spirit will have an <hi>infallible</hi> and <hi>powerful influence</hi> upon the <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Walk</hi> of him who is united to Chriſt.</p>
               <p>Beſides this, there is the <hi>Other Bond (viz.) Faith:</hi> and that too, doth naturally operate and tend to the furtherance of <hi>that converſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> which I am proving. For 'tis of a <hi>purifying nature;</hi> it firſt<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 15.9.</note> 
                  <hi>purifies the heart,</hi> and then conſequently the <hi>ſeveral acts</hi> which iſſue and flow from the heart. Faith is the <hi>juſtifying grace,</hi> but 'tis a<note n="*" place="margin">Act. 26.18.</note> 
                  <hi>ſanctifying grace</hi> too; it <hi>juſtifies before God</hi> but it alſo <hi>ſanctifies before men.</hi> 'Tis not only a bare <hi>inſtrument</hi> or <hi>condition</hi> of <hi>juſtifica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion,</hi> but 'tis likewiſe an <hi>operative</hi> and <hi>influential</hi> grace upon <hi>ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fication.</hi> 'Tis the <hi>lively faith</hi> which <hi>knits</hi> to Chriſt; and being ſo it will ſhew its <hi>livelineſs</hi> by its <hi>vigorous promoting</hi> of the holineſs and ſpiritualneſs of the Believers courſe: inſomuch that<note n="*" place="margin">Jam. 2.26.</note> 
                  <hi>as the body without the ſpirit is dead,</hi> ſo <hi>Faith</hi> without this <hi>ſpiritual walking</hi> is <hi>dead</hi> alſo. It would be a very eaſie thing to deſcend to <hi>Particulars,</hi> therein to ſhow the <hi>ſpecial Methods</hi> in which the <hi>Spirit of God</hi> and <hi>Faith</hi> under it, do work for the keeping down of the <hi>Walking after the fleſh</hi> and the promoting of the <hi>Walking after the ſpirit,</hi> in the <hi>diſtinct</hi> and <hi>ſeveral conſiderations</hi> proper to <hi>each</hi> of them: but I fear I am already too prolix.</p>
               <p>The <hi>ſecond Argument</hi> is taken <hi>from Chriſt's tenderneſs of his Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour.</hi> He will <hi>advance</hi> the <hi>creature,</hi> but hee'l do it in ſuch a way as that he may ſecure and <hi>advance</hi> his own <hi>glory.</hi> Now would this be for the Honour of Chriſt to take perſons into ſo near a <hi>conjunction</hi> with <hi>himſelf,</hi> and yet let them live the <hi>carnal</hi> and <hi>ſenſual life?</hi> to walk juſt as others do who are<note n="*" place="margin">Eph. 2.13.</note> 
                  <hi>afar off</hi> from him? To <hi>be in Chriſt</hi> and yet to <hi>live in ſin,</hi> immers'd in <hi>fleſh</hi> and <hi>ſenſuality,</hi> O what diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour would this reflect upon the <hi>Head</hi> if his <hi>Members</hi> ſhould <hi>thus walk!</hi> Chriſt will have his followers to differ <hi>from others,</hi> yea and <hi>from themſelves too;</hi> therefore all that are <hi>in him</hi> ſhall be<note n="*" place="margin">2 Cor. 5.17.</note>

He can joyn the <hi>greateſt Sinners</hi> to himſelf, but hee'l firſt <hi>prepare</hi> and <hi>adapt</hi> them for ſuch an Union, by making them <hi>other perſons,</hi> and ſo cauſing them to live at <hi>another rate</hi> than they did before.

Again, is your <hi>Spiritual walking ſo viſible</hi> as it ſhould be? ſo as to convince the world that there is <hi>ſuch a life,</hi> ſuch <hi>a courſe</hi> as hath been deſcribed?

'Tis a great miſtake to <hi>limit</hi> this <hi>walking after the Spirit</hi> to actions <hi>materially ſpiritual,</hi> or to the <hi>poſitive duties of Religion;</hi> No, at <hi>all times,</hi> in <hi>all actions</hi> you are <hi>ſo</hi> to walk, doing all <hi>from a ſpiritual Principle, by a ſpiritual Rule, to a ſpiritual End.</hi> 'Tis one thing to be employ'd in ſome <hi>acts that are ſpiritual,</hi> and ano<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther thing to be <hi>ſpiritual in all acts;</hi> the fleſhly Walker may do the <hi>Firſt,</hi> but Saints muſt endeavour after the <hi>Laſt.</hi> At your <hi>Tables,</hi> in your <hi>Shops,</hi> in your <hi>civil Converſes,</hi> you may (and ought) to live the <hi>heavenly life</hi> as well as in hearing the Word, Prayer, and ſuch religious Duties. A carnal man ſometimes engages in <hi>ſpiritual things,</hi> and yet even then he <hi>doth not walk after the Spirit;</hi> and a Child of God ſometimes is engaged in <hi>common things</hi> (<hi>Civil</hi> and <hi>Natural</hi>), and yet even then <hi>he walks after the Spirit; (viz.)</hi> as he <hi>intermingles grace with all he doth.</hi> Now is it thus with you? are you holy, ſpiritual <hi>in all manner of converſation,</hi> in every winding and
<pb n="139" facs="tcp:43599:83"/>turn of the life (as the Apoſtle exhorts 1 <hi>Pet.</hi> 1.15)? And once more let me ask you (and 'pray call your own Souls to account about it), is there not <hi>ſome one</hi> or <hi>other</hi> ſecret <hi>by-path of the Fleſh</hi> which you walk in? this holy <hi>David</hi> prayed againſt, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 139.24. <hi>See if there be [any wicked way] in me, and lead me in the way everlaſting.</hi> Upon the whole, I fear there is need to preſs this upon you to walk yet more and more after the Spirit: and we <hi>beſeech and exhort you by the Lord Jeſus, that as ye have received of us how you ought to walk and to pleaſe God, ſo ye would abound more and more;</hi> 1 <hi>Theſ.</hi> 4.1.—</p>
               <p n="3">3. Thirdly, are you ſuch who walk not after <hi>the Fleſh</hi> but after <hi>the Spirit? O rejoice in this and take the comfort of it!</hi> Here's <hi>ſufficient ground</hi> of <hi>aſſurance</hi> that there is <hi>no condemnation</hi> to you, that you are <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> and is not that matter of rejoicing? You are within the <hi>Character</hi> here given of ſuch who are <hi>in Chriſt,</hi> therefore you are in him, and being in him muſt it not needs be well with you? And if you look into <hi>the following Verſes</hi> there is yet more comfort for you: they tell you that <hi>God ſent his Son to condemn Sin, to fulfil the Law,</hi> and all for ſuch <hi>ſpiritual Walkers</hi> as you are, (for upon them the Character is repeated again).</p>
               <p>Ah (you'l ſay) if it was thus with us we would deſire no higher comfort in the world, but we fear 'tis otherwiſe; we cannot find that we come up to <hi>this deſcription,</hi> and therefore cannot apply <hi>the happineſs</hi> annexed to it. And why ſo? why becauſe there is <hi>ſo much</hi> of <hi>Fleſh</hi> in us, O there is a very ſinful, carnal, and ſenſual part in us! yea, this often <hi>prevails</hi> and breaks forth in our converſation; upon which we cannot but judge that we walk <hi>after the Fleſh</hi> rather than <hi>after the Spirit.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>Now to this I anſwer: Nothing more certain than that <hi>Fleſh is in you,</hi> and will be ſo whilſt you are <hi>in the Fleſh;</hi> you muſt carry it with you to your very grave, the <hi>Body of ſin</hi> and the <hi>other Body</hi> muſt both be buried together; you'le never be wholly rid of a <hi>ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning Nature</hi> and a <hi>carnal part</hi> till you be in heaven. And 'tis true too, this Fleſh doth and will ſometimes <hi>prevail</hi> over you (though the ſeldomer the better): yet this doth not amount <hi>to walking after the Fleſh,</hi> or to the nullifying of <hi>the walking after the Spirit.

Now to bring this to <hi>the Point</hi> in hand! Unregenerate perſons are under the <hi>Law of Sin,</hi> inaſmuch as in that ſtate <hi>Sin</hi> (the depraved Nature) is the <hi>principle</hi> which acts them, and which <hi>ſtrongly, effectu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ally,</hi> nay <hi>impetuouſly</hi> inclines and excites them to what is ſinful. E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>very <hi>Agent</hi> hath its <hi>principle</hi> which acts it <hi>ſtrongly</hi> and <hi>irreſiſtibly;</hi> as <hi>Natural Agents</hi> in <hi>natural acts</hi> have their <hi>principle</hi> working with <hi>great efficacy</hi> in them, the <hi>Fire burns</hi> and cannot do otherwiſe be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe 'tis <hi>determin'd</hi> and <hi>influenc'd</hi> by that <hi>natural principle</hi> which is in it: ſo <hi>Moral Agents</hi> in <hi>Moral acts</hi> have their <hi>efficacious principles</hi> too which work as <hi>ſtrongly</hi> and <hi>powerfully</hi> in them, (the <hi>difference</hi> being always preſerv'd 'twixt <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>Free Agents</hi>). But now theſe <hi>principles</hi> are very <hi>different</hi> according to mens <hi>different ſtate;</hi> where 'tis <hi>the Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt Jeſus</hi> there the <hi>Spirit</hi> is the <hi>principle,</hi> and the <hi>New Nature</hi> too in the Soul as the <hi>principle</hi> doth with a great deal of power and efficacy excite and quicken to what is good; 2 <hi>Cor.</hi> 5.14. <hi>The Love of Chriſt con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtraineth us:</hi> But where it is the <hi>Law of Sin</hi> there Sin is the <hi>principle</hi> which doth alſo ſtrongly excite to what is evil. The Natural man hath <hi>no other principle</hi> than this, and 'tis very <hi>active</hi> in him it ever workng with great <hi>power</hi> and <hi>ſtrength</hi> to draw out his corruption: and <hi>ſo he is under the Law of ſin.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>I conceive this <hi>Law of Sin</hi> (as to its moſt <hi>proper import</hi>) notes the <hi>activeneſs and efficacy of a principle,</hi> rather than the <hi>authority or Soveraignty of a Law</hi> (though that be the word here uſed).

4. Fourthly, <hi>Of all bondage this is the moſt unprofitable.</hi> As to other bondage there may be ſome profit in that, but there's none in this; the <hi>Maſter</hi> may be <hi>cruel</hi> enough to his poor <hi>Servant</hi> and hold him to very <hi>hard</hi> and <hi>ſlaviſh</hi> work, but then he makes him ſome amends by giving him <hi>good wages;</hi> but here's the Sinners un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>happineſs he ſerves <hi>that Maſter</hi> which pays him <hi>no wages</hi> at all (<hi>death</hi> excepted): what doth he get by all his <hi>ſervice, drudging</hi> and <hi>toyling</hi> for <hi>ſin?</hi> ev'n nothing but what he may put <hi>into his eye</hi> (I mean to <hi>mourn</hi> and <hi>weep</hi> over); <hi>what fruit had you then in thoſe things, whereof ye are now aſhamed? Rom.</hi> 6.21. O this <hi>Sin</hi> is the <hi>baſeſt Maſter</hi> that any can ſerve! God is <hi>the beſt</hi> (there's enough to be gained under him), but Sin <hi>the worſt</hi> for there's nothing to be got in <hi>its ſervice</hi> but <hi>broken bones, terrours of Conſcience,</hi> the <hi>loſs of Gods favour,</hi> and <hi>Hell at laſt:</hi> You muſt drudge for it from morning to night, be at its Call and beck upon all occaſions, grind in its mill, run upon its errands, carry its burdens, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> and <hi>what recompence</hi> ſhall you have for all this? I'le tell you, <hi>the loſs of all that is truly good</hi> and <hi>the bearing of all that is truly evil;</hi> you ſhall have <hi>ſhame before men, trouble in your own Souls,</hi> and <hi>the eternal wrath of the great God;</hi> theſe are the <hi>rewards</hi> and <hi>recompences</hi> of <hi>Sin.</hi> Now are not they miſerable who ſerve ſuch a Maſter? and yet ſo it is with all men before Converſion.</p>
               <p n="5">5. Fifthly, <hi>Sins bondage</hi> is the worſe <hi>becauſe they who lie under it are altogether inſenſible of it.</hi> Where 'tis <hi>external</hi> and <hi>civil bondage</hi> men are <hi>ſenſible</hi> enough of that; ô they <hi>groan</hi> under it, would fain be rid of it, all their thoughts are imploy'd to contrive how they may get out of it! The people of <hi>Iſrael ſigh'd, and groaned, and cryed to God becauſe of their bondage, Exod</hi> 2.23. and you read in <hi>this Chapter</hi> how the poor <hi>irrational Creatures</hi> (being under the <hi>bondage</hi> of <hi>corruption</hi>) do <hi>groan</hi> after <hi>deliverance,</hi> (<hi>Ver.</hi> 21, 22); the poor <hi>Chriſtians</hi> in ſlavery under <hi>Infidels</hi> what a ſenſe have they of their thraldom, how would they rejoice might they be but ſet free! But here's the evil of <hi>ſpiritual bondage</hi> men do not <hi>feel it;</hi> nay they will not <hi>believe</hi> it, they have other thoughts of themſelves than that they are under any ſuch thing; who thinks himſelf <hi>ſo free</hi> as he that is a <hi>vaſſal</hi> to <hi>Sin?</hi> The poor deluded Sinner (like ſome <hi>diſtracted</hi> perſons) plays with <hi>his chains,</hi> ſports himſelf with <hi>his fetters,</hi> and looks upon them as if they were his <hi>crown:</hi> ô how doth <hi>Sin</hi> (where 'tis in its <hi>full command</hi> and power) <hi>beſot</hi> its Subjects, and make them carry it as though they were in a <hi>plain frenzy!</hi> Have you not ſometimes been in <hi>Bedlam</hi> ('tis mercy you have been

Nay, they are ſo far from <hi>lamenting</hi> and <hi>groaning</hi> under this <hi>bondage</hi> (as their infelicity), that they <hi>affect</hi> it and make it the matter of their <hi>choice,</hi> they <hi>love</hi> to have it ſo and <hi>refuſe</hi> to have it otherwiſe: they refuſe the <hi>Olive,</hi> the <hi>Vine,</hi> and chuſe rather the <hi>Bramble</hi> to reign over them (I allude to that <hi>parable, Judg.</hi> 9.7, <hi>&amp;c.</hi>) they had rather ſwear <hi>Allegiance</hi> and <hi>Fealty</hi> to <hi>ſin</hi> than to <hi>God;</hi> Chriſt's <hi>government</hi> and dominion is <hi>rejected</hi> and <hi>ſin's</hi> is <hi>preferred,</hi> they rather <hi>hold their bondage than their bondage them,</hi> (according to that of the<note n="*" place="margin">

                  <list>
                     <item>1. <hi>That the moſt of men are under the Law of Sin.

                        <hi>one of a city, and two of a family;</hi> but the <hi>generality</hi> of men are ſtrangers to this work, and therefore they are under the <hi>full power</hi> and <hi>dominion</hi> of a curſed nature.

                     <item>2. Men naturally being under <hi>this Law it doth vehemently and impetuouſly put them upon ſin;</hi> for herein lies its being <hi>a Law</hi> and <hi>a Principle</hi> (as you have heard).

                        <hi>he writes his Law in their heart,</hi> and that being done they cannot but do what that Law enjoyns; juſt ſo it is with Sinners in reference to the <hi>Law of Sin</hi> upon the <hi>writing</hi> of it in <hi>their hearts.</hi>

               <p>Theſe things being conſidered and put together, what's the reaſon that <hi>there is no more ſin in the world?</hi> God knows there is <hi>too much</hi> of it, the Law of Sin is too prevalent in the hearts and lives of the moſt; but yet (I ſay) what is the reaſon that there is <hi>no more of it?</hi> for certainly this <hi>Law of Sin</hi> leads the Unregenerate to do <hi>more evil</hi> than what many, yea <hi>any</hi> of them do. Doubtleſs there are divers who are fully under <hi>Sins power</hi> who yet are kept from many <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ternal groſs acts of it,</hi> and are not altogether ſo bad as it and Satan would have them to be.

               </p>
               <p n="2">2. Secondly it ſhows us alſo the <hi>neceſſity, power,</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of <hi>Renewing Grace.</hi> There's more in <hi>this Grace</hi> than in the <hi>former;</hi> in <hi>reſtraining grace</hi> Sin is a little <hi>curb'd</hi> and <hi>kept in,</hi> but yet it retains its <hi>inward ſtrength</hi> and <hi>power</hi> (as 'twas with <hi>Sampſon</hi> when he was <hi>onely bound,</hi> or as 'tis with <hi>fierce Creatures</hi> when they are in <hi>cages</hi> or <hi>chains</hi>): but in <hi>renewing grace</hi> Sin is <hi>ſubdued, conquered,</hi> much <hi>weakened</hi> in its <hi>ſtrength,</hi> diveſted of its former <hi>abſolute power,</hi> not onely <hi>kept in</hi> but <hi>brought under,</hi> and the Soul brought over to the will and command of God. Now this being effected in and by <hi>renewing grace</hi> 'tis evident that there is a <hi>mighty power</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> in <hi>that Grace;</hi> for that which frees from ſo <hi>great</hi> a <hi>power</hi> (as that of <hi>Sin</hi> before Converſion) muſt needs have a <hi>great power</hi> it it. If <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>newing grace</hi> was a <hi>weak</hi> thing or did act in a <hi>weak</hi> manner, it could never do what it doth; was there not the <hi>Law</hi> of the <hi>Spirit</hi> in it the <hi>Law</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi> would be too hard for it. 'Tis not to be imagin'd that Sin will ever be perſuaded to <hi>reſign</hi> or tamely <hi>to quit</hi> its <hi>power</hi> and <hi>dominion</hi> (which it ſo dearly loves and ſo fiercely contends for); no, it muſt be <hi>forc'd</hi> to this and plainly <hi>overpower'd</hi> or elſe 'twill keep what it hath; therefore in <hi>regeneration</hi> God comes with that <hi>effectual, almighty grace</hi> which ſhall infallibly pull Sin off from the throne (let it do its worſt), with <hi>that power</hi> which all the power of Sin cannot withſtand and ſo the work is done. As you ſee in the caſe of <hi>Peter</hi> (that I may open it by an <hi>alluſion</hi>); you read <hi>Acts</hi> 12.5, <hi>&amp;c.</hi> how he was kept in priſon, bound with two chains, the Keepers before the door kept the priſon, beſides he had Souldiers by him and he ſleeping betwixt them: one would think that now <hi>Herod</hi> had him faſt enough; and yet <hi>Peter</hi> is brought out, how? why the Angel of the Lord comes (in the ſtrength of God) awakens him, bids him ariſe, makes his chains fall off from him, breaks open the priſon doors, and ſo ſets him free: The like you read of <hi>Paul</hi> and <hi>Silas Acts</hi> 16.23. they were thrown into priſon, the Jaylor charged to keep them ſafely, he throws them into the inner priſon, made their feet faſt in the ſtocks, yet for all this they were delivered; how? <hi>Suddenly there was a great earthquake, ſo that the foundations of the priſon were ſhaken, and immediately all the doors were opened, and every ones bonds were looſed:</hi> what could have brought theſe perſons (under theſe circumſtances) out of priſon, but the <hi>miraculous interpoſures</hi> of the <hi>mighty power</hi> of God? and that did it <hi>effectually.</hi> Thus 'tis with men in their <hi>Natural State, Sin</hi> and <hi>Satan</hi> have
<pb n="201" facs="tcp:43599:114"/>them <hi>faſt bound,</hi> ſecur'd in <hi>chains</hi> and <hi>fetters,</hi> they cannot ſtir hand or foot to help themſelves, are fully under the power of their ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mies; how are theſe now <hi>releaſed?</hi> why, God comes and the Spirit comes by <hi>renewing grace,</hi> and therein he <hi>opens</hi> the <hi>doors</hi> of their <hi>hearts</hi> (though ſhut up very faſt), <hi>knocks</hi> off their <hi>fetters,</hi> conquers the <hi>Guard</hi> that is ſet upon them, breaks all the <hi>power</hi> and <hi>force</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> and ſo reſcues them from that <hi>thraldom</hi> and <hi>bondage</hi> which they were under; ô the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>renewing grace!</hi> well might <hi>Paul</hi> ſay <hi>Eph.</hi> 3, 20. <hi>according to the power that worketh in us.</hi> The truth is, in the <hi>freeing</hi> of a Soul from the <hi>Law of Sin,</hi> no <hi>leſs power</hi> is put forth than that very power of God put forth <hi>in the raiſing up of the Lord Jeſus from the dead,</hi> ſo the Apoſtle makes the parallel <hi>Eph.</hi> 1.19, 20. (and that was much above <hi>that power</hi> which was exerted in the reſcuing of the <hi>forementioned perſons</hi> out of their <hi>confinement</hi>). It had been <hi>morally impoſſible</hi> that ever the Children of <hi>Iſrael</hi> ſhould have been freed from the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Pharaoh</hi> and that <hi>woful bondage</hi> they were under, if God himſelf had not <hi>made bare his arm</hi> and brought them out with a <hi>ſtrong and mighty hand,</hi> (as 'tis <hi>Deut.</hi> 6.21. <hi>Pſal.</hi> 136.12.) but 'tis a much harder thing to free the Sinner from his <hi>ſpiritual bondage,</hi> he being under a ſadder <hi>captivity</hi> and held therein by a far <hi>greater ſtrength</hi> than what <hi>Pharaoh</hi> had; ô ſurely no deliverance could be expected from Sins dominion, unleſs <hi>infinite power</hi> was engag'd in the bringing of it about: therefore how <hi>neceſſary</hi> as well as <hi>effica<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cious</hi> is renewing Grace! (but more of this when I come to the <hi>third Obſervation</hi>).—</p>
               <p>One Uſe I have finiſhed; ſeveral Others ſhould have been made of the <hi>Point</hi> in hand, as to ſhew you yet further how you may find out <hi>your particular Caſes,</hi> whether <hi>you be under the Law of Sin</hi> or <hi>not;</hi> how you may <hi>be freed from this Law</hi> if as yet you be not ſo; why you ſhould <hi>labour after this freedom, &amp;c.</hi> But theſe things will as well fall in under the <hi>next Obſervation</hi> and therefore I will there inſiſt upon them.</p>

                  <pb n="204" facs="tcp:43599:116"/>made free from <hi>the Law</hi> of <hi>Sin.</hi> There's a great difference 'twixt the <hi>inbeing</hi> and the <hi>Law</hi> of ſin, 'twixt the <hi>reſidence</hi> and the <hi>reign</hi> of ſin, betwixt Sins <hi>manſion</hi> and Sins <hi>dominion:</hi> Sin will have a <hi>being</hi> in Gods people though it be not a <hi>Law</hi> to them, a <hi>reſidence in them</hi> though it doth not <hi>reign over them,</hi> a <hi>manſion</hi> though it be caſt out of <hi>dominion.</hi> There are none on this ſide of Heaven <hi>ſo pure</hi> but that there is ſome <hi>mixture</hi> in them; they have <hi>corruption</hi> as well as <hi>grace,</hi> (as the <hi>beſt grain</hi> hath its <hi>chaff</hi> and the <hi>brighteſt marble</hi> its <hi>ſpots</hi> and <hi>flaws</hi>): the Regenerate themſelves whilſt here on earth are but like <hi>gold</hi> in the <hi>ore</hi> which hath much of <hi>baſer matter</hi> mingled with it.

All then that we can warrantably and truly fix upon in <hi>this matter</hi> is this, that ſuch who are in the <hi>ſtate</hi> of <hi>grace,</hi> in whom the Spirit hath wrought as the <hi>Spirit of Life,</hi> they are made free from the <hi>Law of Sin,</hi> (that <hi>Law</hi> being taken in its <hi>ſtrict</hi> and <hi>proper notion</hi> accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the explication which hath been given of it, and as noting ſomething more than the <hi>bare power of Sin</hi> with reſpect to <hi>ſome par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ticular acts</hi>).

You have heard there are <hi>two</hi> things which make <hi>Sin</hi> to be <hi>a Law; One</hi> is <hi>authoritative commanding on its part,</hi> the <hi>Other</hi> is <hi>full and free reſignation on the Sinners part to its Commands and impulſions:</hi> now the <hi>

Indeed <hi>Sin</hi> (on its part) will often be laying <hi>its Commands</hi> upon them <hi>magiſterially</hi> and <hi>imperiouſly</hi> enough, but they do not <hi>(on their part)</hi> yield <hi>obedience</hi> or <hi>ſubjection</hi> to thoſe com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mands; poſſibly now and then through infirmity they may hearken to ſomething that Sin enjoyns, but as to their <hi>general courſe</hi> and to the <hi>bent</hi> and <hi>purpoſe</hi> of their hearts they ſay <hi>Sin ſhall not reign ever us.</hi> Sin is onely then <hi>a Law</hi> when <hi>it</hi> hath <hi>habitual, univerſal, entire, ab<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſolute dominion,</hi> and when the <hi>Sinner</hi> gives up himſelf in <hi>willing, rea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy total ſubjection</hi> to it; now its never thus bad with the <hi>Regenerate,</hi> Sins <hi>power</hi> never riſes <hi>ſo high</hi> where <hi>grace</hi> is, in <hi>this reſpect</hi> every Child of God is <hi>made free from the Law of Sin.</hi> And in <hi>this notion</hi> the Apoſtle here takes the <hi>Law of Sin:</hi> in the<note n="*" place="margin">At inquies quomodo <hi>Pau<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lus</hi> ſe libera<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tum jactat à lege Peccati, qui cap. prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cedente quae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtus ſit-ſe adhuc mancipari Legi Peccati, &amp; adhuc ſervire Legi Peccati?

               <p>Once more: in the <hi>Text</hi> you have <hi>the Law of the Spirit of Life</hi> brought in in <hi>oppoſition</hi> to and in order to the <hi>abolition of the Law of Sin;</hi> which being conſidered, it affords a very <hi>weighty argument</hi> for the <hi>proof</hi> of <hi>the Truth</hi> in hand. The Law of the Spirit <hi>is the mighty power of the Spirit put forth in the regenerate Soul, for the reſcuing of it from the power of Sin and the bringing of it under the Rule and Scepter of the Lord Chriſt:</hi> now ſhall this <hi>Spirit</hi> put forth ſuch a <hi>mighty power</hi> for this <hi>very end,</hi> and yet Sin continue as high in its <hi>Soveraignty</hi> as before? what advantage then would the Believer have by <hi>the Law of the Spirit</hi> if <hi>the Law of Sin</hi> ſhould yet be kept up in him? Certainly when this <hi>great Spirit</hi> ſhall vouchſafe to exert his <hi>great power</hi> there muſt be ſome <hi>great effect</hi> produced by it; and what can that be but the delivering of the poor <hi>Captive-Sinner</hi> from <hi>Sins bondage?</hi> the deſtroying of <hi>Satans kingdom?</hi> and the ſetting up of <hi>Chriſts</hi> ſweet and gracious <hi>Government</hi> in the Soul? (but I ſpend time in the proving of that which indeed needs not much proof.)</p>
               <p>In the <hi>application</hi> of the <hi>Doctrine</hi> (which I judge will be more uſeful and neceſſary), I might here take occaſion to <hi>confute</hi> thoſe who miſunderſtanding this paſſage <hi>[being made free from the Law of Sin],</hi> do from thence infer and argue for the <hi>Saints per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> in this Life. But having given you all that <hi>this freedom</hi> con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tains in it (which comes exceeding ſhort of <hi>perfection</hi>), I think I need not (I'm ſure I will not) ſpeak any thing further for the <hi>ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>viating</hi> and <hi>refuting</hi> of that <hi>proud Opinion.</hi> He that here ſaith he was <hi>made free from the Law of Sin,</hi> elſewhere ſaith alſo<note n="*" place="margin">Phil. 3.12.</note> he <hi>had not already attained</hi> nor <hi>was already perfect, &amp;c.</hi> and ſurely he went as far (nay, much further) than any of our <hi>modern Perfectioniſts.</hi> God make us <hi>ſenſible</hi> of <hi>imperfection</hi> in <hi>this State,</hi> and ever to be <hi>preſſing</hi> after and <hi>waiting</hi> for that perfection which only belongs to the <hi>future ſtate!</hi>

O when the Sinner begins to think of changing his maſter, when Chriſt and Grace are competitors with Sin who ſhall rule, how doth it then (though it was quiet before) ſhew it ſelf, and put forth all its ſtrength for the ſecuring of its dominion! We ſay <hi>Natura vexata ſeipſam prodit,</hi> when Sin is <hi>vex'd</hi> and <hi>croſs'd</hi> a little then you ſhall ſee and feel what it is; but ſo long as 'tis pleas'd all is <hi>ſtill</hi> and <hi>calm.</hi> And do any ſay they feel not the <hi>impetuous riſings, ſtirrings,</hi> motions of Sin? doth not this proceed from their <hi>inſenſibleneſs?</hi> if ſo, then Sins power is very high, for <hi>the leſs is the Sinners ſenſe the greater always is Sins power; if all be in peace</hi> 'tis a ſign <hi>the ſtrong man keeps the houſe Luk.</hi> 11.21.

               <p n="4">4. <hi>There may be ſome trouble upon the Conſcience after the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miſſion of ſin, and yet it be the Law of Sin.</hi> 'Twas ſo in <hi>Cain,</hi> in <hi>Ahab,</hi> in <hi>Judas, &amp;c.</hi> where there is <hi>no after-grief</hi> Sin indeed reigns, there may be <hi>ſome after-grief</hi> and yet for all that Sin may reign too.

I do not fruſtrate the Grace of God: for if righteouſneſs come by the Law, then Chriſt is dead in vain.</hi> Gal. 3.11, 21, 22. <hi>But that no man is juſtified by the Law in the ſight of God, it is evident: for, The juſt ſhall live by faith.—Is the Law then againſt the promiſes of God? God forbid.! for if there had been a Law given which could have given life, verily righteouſneſs ſhould have been by the Law. But the Scripture hath concluded all under Sin, that the promiſe by faith of Jeſus Chriſt, might be given to them that believe.</hi> So alſo in his Sermon at <hi>Antioch,</hi> Acts 13.39. <hi>By him all that believe are juſtified from all things, from which ye could not be juſtified by the Law of Moſes.</hi> How full and poſitive are the Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures in the denial of any power to the Law <hi>to juſtifie!</hi> It can <hi>diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cover</hi> Sin, <hi>accuſe</hi> and <hi>judge</hi> for Sin, but it cannot <hi>expiate</hi> Sin or make a man <hi>righteous</hi> before God. There is indeed <hi>the righteouſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſs of the Law,</hi> and (upon that) <hi>righteouſneſs by the Law;</hi> but that now is altogether unattainable further than as 'tis brought a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout and accompliſhed in the <hi>hands of Chriſt;</hi> the Law in <hi>Chriſts hands</hi> can do great things, but in <hi>ours</hi> it can do nothing.</p>
               <p n="2">So alſo the <hi>Law</hi> is <hi>weak</hi> in reference to <hi>Eternal life.</hi> It <hi>could not do</hi> (i. e.) it could not <hi>ſave;</hi> it never yet (as ſepara<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted from Chriſt) carried one Sinner to Heaven: 'tis above the ability of the Law <hi>to ſave one.

Had he continued in the ſtate of innocency: he had been able to have done all which the Law required, and ſo would have attained Life by it in the way of <hi>doing;</hi> but now the caſe is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tered.

Could we but get rid of this <hi>Sin</hi> we ſhould ſoon find what a <hi>mighty thing</hi> the Law is; ſo mighty that nothing would be too high or too hard for it.</p>
               <p n="2">2: Secondly, <hi>Take heed that you do not caſt off the Law upon this pretence.</hi> 'Tis indeed <hi>weak</hi> (as to <hi>ſuch ends</hi>), but yet 'tis <hi>a Law</hi> and that which is <hi>obligatory</hi> to <hi>all</hi> (even to Believers themſelves under the <hi>Goſpel State</hi> and <hi>Covenant</hi>).

                  <hi>Do we then make void the Law through Faith? God forbid! yea we eſtabliſh the Law</hi> (in its <hi>proper place</hi> and <hi>Sphere</hi>). The Creature <hi>as a creature</hi> is under a <hi>natural</hi> (and therefore <hi>indiſpenſable</hi>) <hi>obligation</hi> to this Law; ſo as that nothing can <hi>exempt</hi> him from that obligation.

True indeed, Believers are not under the <hi>curſe, rigor,</hi> or <hi>bondage</hi> of this Law, or under it as it is the <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dition of life:</hi> but they are (and it cannot be otherwiſe) under the <hi>obligation</hi> of <hi>its commands</hi> as to an holy life.

               <p n="3">3: Thirdly, <hi>Neither muſt you upon this look upon the Law as alto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gether weak, or uſeleſs.</hi> I ſay, not as <hi>altogether weak;</hi> for though as to <hi>ſome</hi> things it be under a <hi>total impotency,</hi> yet as to <hi>other</hi> things it ſtill retains its <hi>priſtine power.</hi> It cannot <hi>take away ſin,</hi> or <hi>make righteous,</hi> or <hi>give life</hi> (which it promis'd at firſt and for which it was appointed, <hi>for the commandment was ordained to life</hi> Rom. 7.10); here's the <hi>weak ſide</hi> of the <hi>Law,</hi> as to theſe 'tis <gap reason="foreign">

In a word, its <hi>authority to oblige to duty or puniſhment</hi> is the <hi>ſame</hi> that ever it was, but its <hi>ability</hi> to give <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> or <hi>life</hi> (in which reſpects only the Apoſtle here ſpeaks of it) is not the <hi>ſame.</hi> If God open this Law to you and ſet it home upon your Conſciences, you will find it hath yet a very great ſtrength and efficacy in it: let it not therefore be <hi>altogether weak</hi> in your eye.</p>
               <p>Nor <hi>altogether uſeleſs.</hi> For Some will be ready to ſay, if the Law be thus weak then <hi>what uſe is there of it?</hi> to <hi>what end</hi> doth it ſerve? what is to be looked for from that <hi>which can do ſo little for us?</hi> But do not you thus reaſon!

Thirdly, It lies <hi>in God's authorizing and commiſſionating of Chriſt to what he was to be, and to do.</hi> The Father <hi>ſent him</hi> (that is) gave him <hi>authority</hi> to engage as the <hi>Redeemer</hi> of the world: Chriſt had a <hi>Commiſſion</hi> from God under <hi>hand</hi> and <hi>ſeal</hi> (as it were), be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore he medled in his <hi>great negotiation;</hi> Joh. 6.27. <hi>Him hath God the Father ſealed</hi> (or <hi>authorized</hi> by <hi>ſpecial commiſſion</hi>); for though that be not <hi>all</hi> which is intended in the <hi>ſealing,</hi> yet that is a <hi>great part</hi> of it. As <hi>Princes</hi> when they ſend abroad their <hi>Embaſſadours</hi> or appoint their <hi>Officers</hi> at home, they give them their <hi>Commiſſions ſealed</hi> to be their warrant for what they ſhall do; ſo God the Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther did with Chriſt. He did not <hi>intrude</hi> or thruſt himſelf upon what he undertook; no, but though he had in himſelf a <hi>ſtrong in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clination</hi> thereunto, yet firſt his Father muſt <hi>call</hi> him to it: he did not <hi>run before he was ſent</hi> (as thoſe <hi>Prophets</hi> did Jer. 23.21.). So the Apoſtle tells us <hi>Heb.</hi> 5.4, 5. <hi>No man taketh this honour to him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, but he that was called of God as was Aaron: So alſo Chriſt glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rified not himſelf to be made an High Prieſt, but he that ſaid unto him, thou art my Son this day have I begotten thee.</hi> Joh. 8.42. <hi>I pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeded forth and came from God, neither came I of my ſelf, but he ſent me.</hi> You ſee how his <hi>Sending</hi> is opened by <hi>this;</hi> the due conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration of which doth adminiſter matter of great <hi>ſupport</hi> and <hi>en<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragement</hi> to <hi>Faith,</hi> (as you will hear in the <hi>applying</hi> of the Truth in hand).</item>
                  <item>4. Fourthly, This <hi>Sending</hi> of Chriſt conſiſts <hi>in the Fathers au<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thoritative willing of him to take mans nature upon him, and in that nature ſo to do, and ſo to ſuffer.</hi> This is higher than the <hi>former;</hi> God did not only <hi>authorize</hi> Chriſt to engage, ſo as that he might if he ſo pleas'd undertake to redeem Sinners, without any <hi>intruſion</hi> or <hi>uſurpation;</hi> but he made this known to him as <hi>his Will,</hi> and (to ſpeak according to our conceptions) he laid his <hi>command</hi> upon him to act accordingly. So as that Chriſt was under <hi>an obligati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> (which yet did not in the leaſt <hi>deſtroy</hi> or <hi>leſſen his Liberty,</hi> or <hi>his Merit,</hi> or <hi>his Love</hi>) to come and to do as he did. <hi>Sending</hi> is an <hi>authoritative act</hi> amongſt men; 'twas ſo in God towards Chriſt: the Father did not proceed with him in a way of <hi>meer offer</hi> or <hi>bare propoſal</hi> or <hi>intreaty,</hi> but in a way of <hi>authority;</hi> he laid his <hi>injuncti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on</hi> upon him to aſſume fleſh, and in that fleſh to make ſatisfaction. Therefore when Chriſt entred upon this work, ſpeaking to his Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther
<pb n="293" facs="tcp:43599:164"/>he ſaith<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 10.7.</note> 
                     <hi>Lo I come (in the volume of the book it is written of me) to do thy will O God;</hi> And when he was diſcourſing <hi>of laying down his Life,</hi> he adds<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 10.18.</note> 
                     <hi>This commandment have I received of my Fa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther;</hi> the Apoſtle alſo tells us that<note n="*" place="margin">Phil. 2.8.</note> 
                     <hi>he became [obedient] unto death even the death of the croſs,</hi> (which <hi>obedience</hi> neceſſarily ſup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſes a <hi>command</hi>). And Chriſt was under a <hi>command</hi> in reference to his <hi>incarnation</hi> as well as to his <hi>death</hi> and <hi>paſſion,</hi> for indeed without <hi>that</hi> there could have been none of <hi>this;</hi> therefore the <hi>Text</hi> ſaith <hi>God ſent him in the likeneſs,</hi> &amp;c. that is, God <hi>ordered</hi> him to take our fleſh. This <hi>Sending</hi> then of Chriſt <hi>was the Father's authoritative calling of him to the Office and Work of a Redeemer,</hi> which <hi>Call</hi> was alſo back'd <hi>with poſitive</hi> and <hi>peremptory commands</hi> as to the <hi>management</hi> of <hi>both;</hi> in reſpect of which God is ſaid <hi>to ſend him,</hi> for <hi>mittere Deus dicitur ubi mandata dat</hi> (as <hi>Grotius</hi> gloſſes upon it). And the truth is, Chriſt in the <hi>management</hi> of the <hi>whole work</hi> of our <hi>Redemption</hi> was under, acted by, and accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to <hi>his Fathers comuand:</hi> whereupon God calls him <hi>his Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vant</hi> Iſa. 42.1. Iſa. 53.11. and Chriſt himſelf ſpeaking to his Father ſayes, Joh. 17.4. <hi>I have glorified thee on the earth, I have finiſhed the work which thou gaveſt me to do;</hi> mark that <hi>[which thou gaveſt me to do]</hi> intimating that all his Work was cut out for him by the will of his Father. So Joh. 4.34. <hi>Jeſus ſaith unto them, my meat is to do the will of him that ſent me and to finiſh his work:</hi> Joh. 6.38. <hi>I came down from heaven not to do mine own will but the will of him that ſent me:</hi> upon this account therefore Chriſt may well be ſaid <hi>to be ſent by the Father.</hi> In Scripture 'tis ſometimes God <hi>gave him,</hi> and ſometimes God <hi>ſent him;</hi> Chriſt was <hi>given,</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>freeneſs</hi> of the <hi>Grace</hi> of God <hi>towards us,</hi> and he was <hi>ſent,</hi> in reſpect of the <hi>Father's authority</hi> over <hi>him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>
                  </item>
                  <item>5. Fifthly, take one thing more, God's <hi>Sending</hi> of Chriſt im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ports <hi>his truſting of him with his great deſigns:</hi> (this comes in too, if not <hi>directly,</hi> yet at leaſtwiſe <hi>collaterally</hi> or <hi>concomitantly</hi>). In all <hi>ſending</hi> there is <hi>truſt;</hi> when we ſend a perſon about our affairs we repoſe a truſt in him, that he will be faithful in the management of our concerns; God <hi>ſent Chriſt</hi> (that is) he put a <hi>great truſt</hi> in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to his hands. 'Tis as if the Father had ſaid, <q>My Son! here's a great work to be done, a work upon which my glory doth in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>finitely depend, all now lies at the ſtake, as this is mannag'd it will be well or ill with Souls: Well, <hi>I'le ſend thee,</hi> I'le put all into thy hands, venture all with thee; I know thou wilt be

               <p>Before I go off from <hi>this Head</hi> I deſire <hi>One thing</hi> may be taken notice of; It muſt be granted, that the <hi>ſending</hi> of Chriſt was <hi>prae<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vious</hi> and <hi>antecedent</hi> to ſeveral of the <hi>Things</hi> which have been mentioned, (as the <hi>demonſtrations</hi> of his <hi>ſuperlative fitneſs</hi> to be <hi>ſent,</hi> and the <hi>grounds</hi> of his being <hi>ſent</hi>): Yet nevertheleſs they may be alledged and made uſe of in <hi>that notion,</hi> becauſe though in <hi>our ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prehenſion</hi> (if not alſo in the <hi>Nature</hi> of the <hi>Thing</hi>) they were <hi>af<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter</hi> the <hi>ſending,</hi> yet in the <hi>eye</hi> and <hi>eſtimation</hi> of God they were <hi>be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it.</hi> For inſtance, Chriſt juſt <hi>at his ſending</hi> had not then <hi>aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſumed</hi> the <hi>Humane Nature,</hi> (we ſuppoſe <hi>that</hi> to <hi>antecede</hi> his <hi>incar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nation</hi>); yet God judged him a perſon <hi>fit</hi> to be <hi>ſent</hi> becauſe of <hi>that Nature.</hi> And ſo he might very well; for <hi>though</hi> the <hi>incarnation</hi> as conſidered in <hi>it ſelf</hi> was <hi>future,</hi> yet as to the <hi>knowledge, conſide<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ration, eſtimation</hi> of God, it was <hi>preſent</hi> and done already.

               <p n="4">4. Fourthly, God therefore ſent Chriſt, not only becauſe he was the <hi>fitteſt Perſon</hi> to be ſent, but becauſe indeed <hi>he was the only Perſon that could be ſent; for none but he could effect or accompliſh Man's Redemption.</hi> If God will be ſo <hi>gracious</hi> as to <hi>ſend,</hi> 'twas not only <hi>convenient</hi> but <hi>neceſſary</hi> that he ſhould ſend this <hi>very per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon</hi> his <hi>own Son;</hi> for there was <hi>none Other</hi> in heaven or earth that could go through an undertaking of this nature.

<pb n="302" facs="tcp:43599:169"/>he (being ſtill a <hi>meer Creature</hi>) could never <hi>ſatisfie</hi> for what was <hi>paſt,</hi> not <hi>merit</hi> for what was <hi>to come;</hi> he could neither <hi>expiate ſin</hi> nor <hi>procure eternal Life.</hi> No, theſe are things which could <hi>only</hi> be accompliſhed by Him who was <hi>more</hi> than a meer <hi>finite</hi> or <hi>crea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted being,</hi> even by the Lord Jeſus who was <hi>Man</hi> but <hi>God</hi> too; wherefore he's the Perſon whom the <hi>Father</hi> will <hi>ſend.</hi> And he very well underſtood himſelf in what he did; if the work had been <hi>poſſible</hi> to have been effected by <hi>any Creature,</hi> God would have employd <hi>that Creature</hi> and ſpar'd his <hi>own Son;</hi> nothing but <hi>abſolute neceſſity</hi> made him to fix upon <hi>this courſe.</hi>

               </p>
               <list>
                  <item>1.

                  </item>
                  <item>2. That <hi>this Jeſus was ſo ſent by God</hi> (to be the <hi>true and only Meſſiah</hi>), as that <hi>beſides</hi> and <hi>after him no other Perſon is to be ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pected in that nature</hi> or <hi>quality to be ſent by God.</hi>
                  </item>
               </list>
               <p>Now though theſe be <hi>two as weighty</hi> and <hi>as Fundamental Truths</hi> to us Chriſtians <hi>(as Chriſtians)</hi> as any whatſoever; and though I could not hope to reach the <hi>great Enemies</hi> of the Goſpel ſo as to faſten <hi>any conviction</hi> upon them, yet probably I might (in the purſuing of <hi>this Argument</hi>) reach ſome <hi>weak Chriſtians,</hi> ſo as to <hi>confirm</hi> &amp; <hi>ſtabliſh</hi> them in the <hi>belief</hi> of theſe <hi>great Truths;</hi> yet I ſhall not at preſent engage in the diſcuſſing of theſe <hi>two Propoſitions. Firſt</hi> becauſe in ſo <hi>great Points</hi> 'tis better <hi>to ſay nothing</hi> then not to ſpeak <hi>fully</hi> and <hi>throughly</hi> to them; which if I could (other Diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>couragements being removed) hope to do, yet here in <hi>this place,</hi> without making the Work in hand too vaſt and big, to be ſure I could not. <hi>Secondly</hi> becauſe (however <hi>pertinent</hi> this Undertaking might be to ſome <hi>other Texts</hi>) to <hi>that</hi> which I am upon it would not be <hi>ſo pertinent:</hi> where the Apoſtles <hi>drift</hi> and <hi>deſign</hi> is not ſo much (in <hi>oppoſition</hi> to <hi>Jews</hi> and <hi>Infidels</hi>) to aſſert that <hi>Chriſt was the very Perſon ſent of God,</hi> as to aſſign (for the <hi>Comfort</hi> of <hi>Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lievers</hi>) the <hi>Way</hi> and <hi>Courſe</hi> which God took <hi>to bring about their Salvation,</hi> when upon the <hi>terms</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> it was <hi>impoſſible,</hi> (namely he <hi>ſent his own Son</hi> &amp;c). The <hi>Text</hi> therefore not tying me to it, I may wave it; I ſhall have work enough to go over what the <hi>proper</hi> and <hi>immediate Senſe</hi> of the <hi>Contents</hi> of this <hi>Chapter</hi> will lead me to, and therefore I may well <hi>cut off</hi> what is of a <hi>more remote</hi> and <hi>forraign Conſideration.</hi> So that this ſhall ſuffice for the <hi>Firſt Obſervation, Chriſt was ſent, and ſent by God the Father.</hi>

<pb n="364" facs="tcp:43599:200"/>made his humble obeyſance to the <hi>Emperour himſelf</hi> and ſhewed him all reverence, but as for <hi>his Son</hi> he paſſed him by, ſhewed him no reſpect at all, rather dealt <hi>deriſorily</hi> with him, ſtroking him upon his head and ſaying to him (in a way of contempt) <hi>Salve &amp; tu Fili:</hi> The <hi>Emperour</hi> upon this was much offended, ſharply reproves <hi>Amphilochius</hi> for his affront to his Son &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>upon the good man vindicates his carriage, plainly telling the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> he had given reverence enough to <hi>his Son.</hi> And now the <hi>Emperour</hi> was more incens'd, commands him with great indigna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion to be thruſt out of his preſence &amp;c. which whilſt ſome was doing, <hi>Amphilochius</hi> turn'd himſelf to the <hi>Emperour</hi> and ſaid thus, <hi>O Emperour! thou being but a man canſt not bear the contempt or diſparagement of thy Son; how doſt thou think the great God can bear that contempt of his Son which the</hi> Arrians <hi>caſt upon him?</hi> the <hi>Em<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>perour</hi> was much affected at this, begg'd the Biſhop's pardon, com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mended his ingeny, and did that now which he refus'd to do be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore.

If you ask me, <hi>how?</hi> I anſwer, <hi>every honouring</hi> of him is not ſufficient but it muſt be ſuch as may <hi>ſuit</hi> with his <hi>infinite Majeſty</hi> and <hi>Greatneſs;</hi> you muſt conceive of him as <hi>God,</hi> as the <hi>Natural</hi> and <hi>eternal Son</hi> of God, and according to that <hi>honour</hi> which is due to him <hi>as ſuch</hi> ſo you muſt honour him.

               <p>But more <hi>particularly</hi> there's a <hi>twofold Honour</hi> which you muſt all give to Chriſt:</p>

Further, the Lord Jeſus as he in our <hi>Nature</hi> hath done ſuch great and excellent things for us is to be worſhipped; yet this is only a <hi>forcible motive</hi> and <hi>inducement</hi> thereunto, not the <hi>proper ground</hi> of it: it remains then that the <hi>alone reaſon</hi> of Worſhip given or done to Chriſt is his <hi>being God</hi> and the <hi>co-equal, co-eſſential Son of God.</hi> And he being ſo, what an obligation doth this lay upon you to worſhip him? there's <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ward worſhip</hi> (conſiſting in the <hi>truſt, fear, reverence, adoration</hi> of the heart), there's <hi>outward worſhip</hi> (conſiſting in attendance up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on and due obſervance of <hi>Goſpel-inſtitutions,</hi> as <hi>Prayer, Hearing the Word</hi> &amp;c); in both of <hi>theſe reſpects</hi> let Chriſt be worſhipped by you, <hi>both</hi> are due to him as he is <hi>God's own Son.</hi> Well may you tender <hi>your homage</hi> to him in this way when <hi>Angels</hi> them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelves bow before him and worſhip at his <hi>throne.</hi>

                  <hi>actually</hi> done; inſomuch that they had the <hi>ſame benefit</hi> by a <hi>Chriſt in Fleſh</hi> which we now have: Therefore 'tis ſaid Rom. 3.25. <hi>Whom God ſet forth to be a propitiation through faith in his blood, to declare his righteouſneſs for the remiſſion of ſins [that are paſt] through the forbearance of God:</hi> Heb. 9.15. <hi>For this cauſe he is the Media<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tour of the New Teſtament, that by means of death, for the redempti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on of the trrnſgreſſions [that were under the firſt Teſtament], they which are called might receive the promiſe of eternal inheritance:</hi> Whatever our Lord is now ſince the <hi>actual exhibition</hi> of him, he was the ſame before <hi>effectively</hi> and <hi>virtually,</hi> for 'tis <hi>Jeſus Chriſt the ſame yeſterday, and to day, and for ever</hi> Heb. 13.8.

O ſuch a thing was not poſſible! God can take a <hi>ſinning</hi> (if repenting) <hi>Creature</hi> into <hi>his boſom,</hi> but he cannot take a <hi>ſinning Nature</hi> into <hi>his Perſon.</hi> Chriſt might con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deſcend to <hi>take fleſh</hi> &amp; yet <hi>be God,</hi> but he could not have taken <hi>ſinful fleſh</hi> and yet <hi>be God:</hi> the humane nature (ſimply conſidered) was not inconſiſtent with his Godhead, but that Nature (if ſinful) was.</p>

Secondly, this further informs us <hi>of the excellency and glory of Chriſt's Fleſh and Manhood;</hi> from the <hi>premiſes</hi> it clearly appears that that is (and needs muſt be) <hi>ſuperlatively</hi> great. Was Chriſt himſelf <hi>ſent in fleſh?</hi> did God's <hi>own Son</hi> aſſume and <hi>ſo aſſume fleſh?</hi> O what a <hi>luſtre</hi> and <hi>glory</hi> muſt there be upon <hi>that fleſh</hi> (or <hi>body</hi>) which <hi>ſuch a perſon</hi> doth <hi>ſo aſſume!</hi> 'Tis call'd after its being <hi>glorified</hi> in him, <hi>a glorious body</hi> Phil. 3.21. but 'twas <hi>a glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rious body</hi> long before, even from the <hi>firſt moment</hi> of its <hi>formation</hi>
                  <pb n="418" facs="tcp:43599:227"/>and <hi>aſſumption.</hi> 'Tis true, its glory whilſt 'twas <hi>here on earth</hi> did not ſhine forth in its <hi>full brightneſs,</hi> there was a <hi>vail</hi> and <hi>covering</hi> upon it during the ſtate of <hi>Chriſt's Humiliation;</hi> but yet even then 'twas <hi>full</hi> of <hi>glory</hi> though the <hi>fulneſs,</hi> of its <hi>glory</hi> did not ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pear, (as the <hi>Sun</hi> is very glorious even when 'tis <hi>hid</hi> under a <hi>cloud</hi>). And indeed 'twas requiſite, not only from the <hi>ſtate</hi> of his <hi>abaſement,</hi> but alſo from the <hi>weakneſs</hi> of thoſe with whom he was to converſe, that here he ſhould very much <hi>keep in</hi> its <hi>glory,</hi> for we ſee when at his <hi>transfiguration</hi> he let it break forth in a more than <hi>ordinary manner,</hi> the beholders thereof could not well bear it, it fill'd them with <hi>conſternation;</hi> (read Matth. 17.1. &amp;c.) But yet, upon its <hi>miraculous framing,</hi> its <hi>unſtain'd</hi> and <hi>unſpotted ſancti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty,</hi> its <hi>neer union</hi> with the <hi>Godhead,</hi> even here (I ſay) its glory was exceeding great. O what a ſight will it be in heaven to ſee <hi>this body</hi> of Chriſt in all its <hi>ſplendor,</hi> and to ſee him in <hi>this Fleſh</hi> ſitting at the right hand of God! As he was at firſt <hi>ſent in it</hi> 'twas but <hi>mean</hi> (in external appearance and to meer ſenſe), but now he is <hi>aſcended</hi> and hath <hi>carried it up</hi> with him and 'tis <hi>plac'd</hi> at the right hand of God, ſo 'tis an <hi>Object</hi> ſo glorious that 'tis fit only for a <hi>glorify'd eye</hi> to behold.</p>
               <p>And doth the <hi>Body</hi> of Chriſt engroſs all this glory? hath his <hi>Soul</hi> no part or ſhare therein? yes ſurely! it may rather be ask'd: hath not that the <hi>greateſt ſhare,</hi> (it being the <hi>better</hi> and <hi>nobler part,</hi> and capable of that of which the <hi>Body</hi> is not)? If God prepare ſo <hi>excellent a body</hi> hee'l be ſure anſwerably to prepare <hi>as excellent a ſoul</hi> to dwell in that body, (as they that build ſtately houſes will put in inhabitants that ſhall be anſwerable to them). Imagine a Soul untouch'd and unblemiſh'd with ſin, fully and perfectly ſanctify'd, fill'd with grace to the utmoſt of its capacity, having nothing in its <hi>ſeveral faculties</hi> but <hi>truth</hi> in the <hi>

Indeed if we conſider theſe <hi>conſtitutive parts</hi> of Chriſt's <hi>Manhood</hi> as they ſtand <hi>apart</hi> and <hi>by themſelves,</hi> they are excellent to a very <hi>high degree;</hi> but if we go further and con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſider them in the <hi>Hypoſtatick <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion,</hi> then we are at a mighty loſs and cannot conceive what a glory is by that conferr'd upon them. As ſuppoſe a <hi>Pearl</hi> was put into a glaſs of <hi>Chryſtal,</hi> that would put a great <hi>radiancy</hi> upon it; but what if the <hi>Sun</hi> it ſelf could be put into this <hi>glaſs,</hi> how <hi>radiant</hi> then would it be? So
<pb n="419" facs="tcp:43599:227"/>here, the Lord Chriſt having ſo precious <hi>a Soul</hi> dwelling in his <hi>Fleſh,</hi> even that (if there was nothing more) muſt make it very glorious; but when the <hi>Godhead</hi> it ſelf dwells in it, how un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpeakable muſt its glory and ſplendor needs be!</p>
               <p>Leaving the <hi>parts</hi> let me ſpeak to the <hi>whole;</hi> the <hi>whole humane nature</hi> in Chriſt is <hi>tranſcendently excellent.</hi> If the <hi>eſſential</hi> and <hi>eternal Son of God</hi> will ſo far condeſcend as to aſſume <hi>Man's Nature,</hi> cer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tainly in him the <hi>Manhood</hi> muſt have all that <hi>dignity, glory, per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fection</hi> that ever it was capable of: and ſurely never was the <hi>Humane Nature</hi> ſo <hi>advanc'd</hi> as in <hi>Chriſt.</hi> If you conſider it as 'tis <hi>in us,</hi> ſo it hath its <hi>worth</hi> and <hi>excellency;</hi> for man is yet a <hi>glorious creature,</hi> (though 'tis too true by the loſs of <hi>God's image</hi> he hath loſt very much of his glory): As he was at firſt <hi>created</hi> in the ſtate of innocency he was high indeed; by the <hi>Fall</hi> the caſe is ſadly altered, the Humane Nature now is exceedingly <hi>de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bas'd</hi> and <hi>depreſs'd;</hi> but yet even <hi>in its ruins</hi> (as 'twas with <hi>old Carthage</hi>) it may be ſeen what <hi>once</hi> it <hi>was: much</hi> is loſt and the <hi>beſt</hi> is loſt, but <hi>all</hi> is not loſt; the glory of the <hi>Saint</hi> is gone, but the glory of the <hi>Man</hi> (in a great meaſure) yet remains.

I ſay a Chriſt (thus ſtated) they <hi>decry</hi> and <hi>diſregard:</hi> (O that from what I have heard and read I had not too juſt occaſion for this charge!) Tis highly neceſſary therefore that I ſhould ſay ſomething to <hi>an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tidote</hi> you againſt this <hi>venome;</hi> that under the pretence of a <hi>Chriſt within</hi> you do not loſe or overlook a <hi>Chriſt without.</hi> In a <hi>ſober ſenſe</hi> we are for a <hi>Chriſt within</hi> as much as any; viz. as he is <hi>formed</hi> in the Soul at the <hi>new birth</hi> Gal. 4.19, as he is <hi>united</hi> to and <hi>dwells</hi> in believers Col. 1.27. Rom. 8.10. but yet 'tis a <hi>Chriſt without,</hi> as <hi>incarnate,</hi> whom we <hi>rely</hi> upon for <hi>life</hi> and <hi>ſalvation;</hi> as he is <hi>ſo conſidered,</hi> we eye him in the <hi>great acts</hi> of <hi>faith</hi> and ground all our <hi>hope</hi> and <hi>confidence</hi> upon him. I have<note n="*" place="margin">p. 310.</note> before told you, that a Chriſt <hi>as formed in the heart</hi> is neceſſary to <hi>juſtification</hi> and <hi>ſalvation</hi> (for he ſaves none but thoſe who have this <hi>inward work</hi>); but yet 'tis a Chriſt <hi>as formed in the Virgins womb</hi> and <hi>as dying upon the Croſs,</hi> who is the <hi>proper, efficient, meritorious, pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>curing Cauſe</hi> of Juſtification and Salvation. Theſe <hi>two</hi> muſt by no means be <hi>parted,</hi> yet their <hi>efficiency</hi> or <hi>cauſal influence</hi> upon Sinners good is very <hi>different;</hi> for by the one mercy is <hi>procur'd,</hi> by the other 'tis only <hi>apply'd;</hi> the <hi>impetration</hi> is by the <hi>Chriſt without,</hi>
                  <pb n="425" facs="tcp:43599:230"/>the <hi>application</hi> only is by the <hi>Chriſt within:</hi> And therefore though you are to put an high value upon the <hi>latter,</hi> and to endeavour to make ſure of it as the <hi>way</hi> and <hi>condition</hi> of receiving benefit by Chriſt; yet you are to know that 'tis the <hi>former</hi> by which all is <hi>merited,</hi> and therefore there the great ſtreſs of your Faith muſt lie: 'tis a Chriſt <hi>as taking fleſh</hi> and <hi>dying in fleſh</hi> that you muſt ſtick unto. Matth. 1.21. <hi>She ſhall bring forth a Son, and thou ſhalt call his name Jeſus, for he ſhall ſave his people from their ſins:</hi> (Chriſt the <hi>Son</hi> of <hi>Mary</hi> was to ſave) 1 Tim. 1.15. <hi>This is a faith<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful ſaying, and worthy of all acceptation, that Chriſt Jeſus [came into the world] to ſave ſinners</hi> &amp;c. (the Apoſtle layes the <hi>meriting</hi> of <hi>Salvation</hi> upon a <hi>Chriſt without,</hi> as coming <hi>into the world</hi> and not as coming <hi>into the heart</hi>); he who died upon the Croſs, was ſlain, ſuffer'd at <hi>Jeruſalem,</hi> hee's the perſon whom God hath exalted <hi>to be Prince, and Saviour,</hi> Acts 5.30, 31. <hi>The God of our Fathers raiſed up Jeſus, whom ye ſlew and hanged on a tree; him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Saviour, for to give repentance to Iſrael and forgiveneſs of ſins:</hi> (ſurely where perſons have not forfeited the very <hi>principles</hi> of <hi>Chriſtianity,</hi> this is a thing which needs no proof). Indeed Chriſt <hi>in the Spi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rit</hi> will very little profit thoſe who diſregard him <hi>in the fleſh.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>But no more of this! <hi>Paul</hi> hath a paſſage which I would a little open; 2 Cor. 5.16. <hi>Henceforth</hi> (ſaith he) <hi>know we no man after the fleſh; yea, though we have known Chriſt after the fleſh, yet now henceforth know we him no more:</hi> how? <hi>know Chriſt no more after the fleſh?</hi> what doth he mean by this? did he caſt off all re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſpects to him, all relyance upon him, as conſidered in his Fleſh? O no! all that he aims at is this, he knew Chriſt no more <hi>after the fleſh</hi> (that is) ſo as to have <hi>any further converſe</hi> with him in a <hi>fleſhly way;</hi> he did not expect again to <hi>eat</hi> and <hi>drink</hi> with him (as ſometimes the Apoſtles had done), all that <hi>external converſe</hi> was now at an end: Or he means that he did not look for any <hi>fleſhly advantages</hi> by him, (as worldly <hi>honor, preferment, riches</hi> &amp;c.): Or again, that he did not know him as in the <hi>ſtate</hi> of his <hi>former abaſement</hi> and <hi>humiliation;</hi> (ſo the word <hi>fleſh</hi> is ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times taken more <hi>reſtrainedly,</hi> ſee Heb. 5.7.) Thus you are to underſtand the Apoſtle in <hi>theſe words,</hi> and not as if he laid aſide all knowledge of or reſpects unto the Lord Jeſus, as con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſidered in his <hi>Humane Nature.</hi>
               </p>
               <p>In believing we muſt eye <hi>a whole Chriſt,</hi> Chriſt <hi>God</hi> and Chriſt <hi>Man</hi> too; his <hi>whole Perſon</hi> with <hi>both</hi> his <hi>Natures</hi> is the <hi>proper

               <p>
                  <hi>Euchariſtical</hi> were thoſe that were deſign'd for the expreſſing of gratitude, for the giving of thanks and praiſe to the Lord upon the receiving of mercy: of which you reade Lev. 7.15.—22.29. Pſal. 50.14. Hoſ. 14.2. (but theſe I am not concerned about).</p>

                  <hi>Expiatory</hi> were thoſe that were deſign'd <hi>for the atoning and pacifying of God, the averting of his anger, the doing away the guilt of Sin, and the preventing or removing of the puniſhment of it:</hi> theſe were the Sacrifices which took up the greateſt room in the body of <hi>Moſaical Sacrifices,</hi> and which did <hi>in ſpecial point</hi> to the <hi>grand Sacrifice</hi> of our Lord Jeſus, and to that too as <hi>expiatory.</hi>

It appears that here Chriſt's Sacrifice was exhibited (or that here he made his <hi>expiatory Offering</hi>), becauſe the Scripture ſpeaks of it <hi>as a thing that is paſt,</hi> and <hi>antecedent</hi> to his <hi>exaltation</hi> and <hi>glo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry;</hi> and therefore it muſt be done here <hi>on earth</hi> and not in <hi>Heaven.</hi> Eph. 5.2.—<hi>and [hath given] himſelf for us, an Offering, a Sacrifice to God for a ſweet ſmelling ſavour:</hi> Heb. 1.3.—<hi>when he [had] by himſelf purged our ſins, he ſate down on the right hand of the Majeſty on high;</hi> (mark it, the <hi>Sacrifice-purgation</hi> or <hi>expia<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> of ſin was over and done, and then Chriſt's <hi>exaltation</hi> in Hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven followed after): Heb. 9.12. <hi>Neither by the blood of Goats and Calves, but by his own blood he entred in once into the holy place, [having obtained]</hi> (not to obtain) <hi>eternal redemption for us:</hi> Heb. 10.12. <hi>But this man [after he had offered] one Sacrifice for ſins for ever, ſate down on the right hand of God:</hi> he did not firſt ſit down on the right hand of God and then offer up his Sacrifice for ſins, but he firſt offered and then he ſat down on the right hand of God.</p>
               <p n="2">2. When the Scripture ſpeaks of Chriſt's <hi>expiation of ſin</hi> by the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> of himſelf, it ſpeaks of it <hi>as a thing done but once;</hi> there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore it muſt refer to his <hi>death</hi> which was but <hi>once,</hi> not to his <hi>inter<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceſſion</hi> (or any <hi>other act</hi>) in Heaven which is a<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 7.25.</note> 
                  <hi>continued, re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>peated</hi> and <hi>reiterated act.</hi> Heb. 9.26. <hi>For then muſt he often have ſuffered ſince the foundation of the world; but now [once] in the end of the world hath he appeared to put away ſin by the Sacrifice of him<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf.</hi>—Verſ. 28. <hi>Chriſt was [once] offered to bear the ſins of many:</hi> Heb. 7.27.—<hi>this he did [once] when he offered up himſelf:</hi> Heb. 10.10. <hi>By the which will we are ſanctified, through the offering of the body of Jeſus Chriſt [once] for all.</hi> Doth this <hi>once</hi> agree with any thing that he now doth <hi>in Heaven?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="3">
                  <pb n="506" facs="tcp:43599:271"/>
3. If Chriſt had not diſpatch'd his <hi>expiatory work</hi> at his <hi>death,</hi> why did he then ſay<note n="*" place="margin">Joh. 19.30.</note> 
                  <hi>It is finiſhed?</hi> if his <hi>expiating</hi> of <hi>ſin</hi> was yet <hi>to come</hi> and to be done <hi>in Heaven,</hi> how could he with truth have ſpoken theſe words that all was <hi>finiſhed</hi> when the great thing was yet <hi>undone?</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. That of the Apoſtle is pertinent to our purpoſe, Heb. 10.5. <hi>Wherefore when he [cometh into the world] he ſaith, Sacrifice and offering thou wouldſt not, but a body haſt thou prepared me</hi> &amp;c. where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore did Chriſt come into <hi>the world?</hi> why, to be <hi>a Sacrifice</hi> and to do that which the <hi>old Sacrifices</hi> could not; God was e'ene weary of them, could no longer<note n="*" place="margin">Heb. 10.8.</note> 
                  <hi>take pleaſure</hi> in them, he will have Chriſt (the better Sacrifice) to come into the world, which accordingly he did. I but what was <hi>the world</hi> into which he came? ſurely it muſt be this <hi>lower world:</hi> for it muſt be underſtood of <hi>that world</hi> into which he came <hi>to do the Will of God</hi> (as appears <hi>Verſ.</hi> 7.9.), now that was this <hi>World below</hi> rather than <hi>that above;</hi> for where do we reade that Chriſt aſcended into the <hi>upper World</hi> to <hi>do the Will of God?</hi> eſpecially this <hi>Will of God</hi> referring to his <hi>aſſuming</hi> a <hi>body</hi> and <hi>offering</hi> up that <hi>body</hi> (Verſ. 5.10.)? theſe were things to be done only on this <hi>lower ſtage</hi> of <hi>earth:</hi> whence then it follows that <hi>here</hi> his <hi>Sacrifice</hi> was made.</p>
               <p n="5">5. There was (as hath been obſerv'd) to be an <hi>analogie</hi> and <hi>re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſemblance</hi> 'twixt Chriſt's <hi>Sacrifice</hi> and the <hi>Levitical Sacrifices,</hi> and he was to <hi>expiate in that way</hi> wherein they did expiate; but if you do not place his <hi>Sacrifice</hi> in his <hi>death</hi> where will that <hi>analogie</hi> be? or how will he expiate in <hi>that way</hi> wherein they did? What is there in Chriſt as <hi>in Heaven</hi> that carries any reſemblance to the <hi>killing, ſlaying, ſhedding</hi> the <hi>blood, offering</hi> of the <hi>Levitical Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices?</hi> There he ſits in <hi>great glory,</hi> puts forth his <hi>Regal power,</hi> is <hi>Head</hi> of Church &amp;c. but what's all this to <hi>ſuffering, dying,</hi> pouring out <hi>his blood,</hi> wherein he was to anſwer to thoſe Sacri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fices? Doth the Scripture lay ſo much upon his <hi>death</hi> and <hi>blood</hi> for <hi>expiation,</hi> and yet ſhall <hi>that</hi> be done where there is none of theſe?</p>
               <p>'Twill be ſaid, there's this in Chriſt in Heaven to carry <hi>reſem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>blance</hi> to the <hi>old Sacrifices,</hi> their <hi>blood</hi> was carried by the <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> into the Holy of Holy's, and there ſprinkled by him towards the <hi>Mercy-ſeat;</hi> upon which <hi>expiation</hi> and <hi>atonement</hi> followed: now parallel to this Chriſt himſelf (our High-Prieſt) is entred into Heaven, the Sanctuary not made with hands, and there he executes his Prieſtly Office (after a ſort) for expiation and atone<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment
<pb n="507" facs="tcp:43599:271"/>alſo. To which I reply, Chriſt's <hi>entrance into Heaven</hi> can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not be deny'd, nor that that doth much reſemble what was done by the High-Prieſt under the Law (all that being but <hi>typical</hi> of this); Heb. 9.24. <hi>For Chriſt is not entred into the holy places made with hands, which are the figures of the true; but into Heaven it<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelf, now to appear in the preſence of God for us.</hi> And therein we have the <hi>ſecond part</hi> of his <hi>Prieſthood</hi> (the <hi>oblation</hi> of himſelf here <hi>on earth</hi> being the <hi>firſt</hi> and his <hi>interceſſion</hi> in <hi>heaven</hi> the <hi>ſecond</hi>): which two muſt not be <hi>divided</hi> but <hi>conjoyn'd,</hi> the <hi>former</hi> muſt not juſtle out the <hi>latter</hi> nor the <hi>latter</hi> the <hi>former.</hi> Which <hi>ſecond part</hi> of his <hi>Prieſthood</hi> was neceſſary <hi>partly</hi> in reſpect of <hi>Chriſt himſelf;</hi> for the <hi>com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pleating</hi> and <hi>conſummating</hi> of his <hi>Prieſthood</hi> (the <hi>perfection</hi> and <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellency</hi> of which depended upon it); for (ſaith the Apoſtle) Heb. 8.4. <hi>If he were on earth he ſhould not be a Prieſt</hi> (i.e. not a Prieſt of the <hi>higheſt rank,</hi> he would come ſhort of the <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> and be but as one of the <hi>ordinary Prieſts,</hi> if he ſhould only offer <hi>with<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>out</hi> and after that not enter into the <hi>Sanctuary</hi> as the <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> did, and he <hi>only</hi>): And <hi>partly</hi> too in reſpect of <hi>Believers,</hi> that he might not only make his <hi>oblation</hi> for them in order to <hi>impetra<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi> (which he had done <hi>on earth</hi>), but that he might further <hi>preſent</hi> and <hi>plead</hi> the <hi>merit</hi> of that <hi>oblation</hi> in order to <hi>application,</hi> and the <hi>actual</hi> giving out the <hi>benefits</hi> purchas'd and <hi>merited</hi> thereby (which was to be done <hi>in Heaven</hi>): therefore this we readily grant and firmly believe. But that our Lord's <hi>whole Prieſthood</hi> doth lie in this, or that he only in this <hi>place</hi> and <hi>ſtate</hi> doth <hi>expiate ſin,</hi> or that his <hi>reſemblance</hi> herein to the <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> is ſufficient, that we utterly deny: For</p>
               <p n="1">1. The Scripture (as hath been proved) in drawing the <hi>par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rallel</hi> 'twixt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and the <hi>Law-Sacrifices,</hi> doth not inſtance only in what was done by the <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> in the <hi>Holy</hi> of <hi>Holy's,</hi> but alſo in what was done by the <hi>other Prieſts</hi> in the <hi>Temple,</hi> and in thoſe <hi>ſacrificial acts</hi> which were proper to <hi>them</hi> as well as to <hi>him.</hi> Nay</p>
               <p n="2">2. It <hi>mainly</hi> inſtances in <hi>theſe;</hi> making the <hi>reſemblance</hi> chiefly to lie in the <hi>mactation</hi> and <hi>oblation</hi> of thoſe <hi>Sacrifices</hi> which was done <hi>without;</hi> and therefore it muſt be <hi>Chriſt's death</hi> on the <hi>Croſs</hi> and not his <hi>interceſſion</hi> in <hi>Heaven</hi> which muſt be meant by them.</p>
               <p n="3">3. As that which is aſſerted by our <hi>Oppoſers</hi> would utterly de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtroy all <hi>analogie</hi> 'twixt <hi>Chriſt</hi> and thoſe <hi>Prieſts,</hi> and the far greateſt part of <hi>Sin-expiating Sacrifices;</hi> ſo it would in truth leave Chriſt <hi>no Sacrifice</hi> or <hi>oblation</hi> at all: inaſmuch as what he doth <hi>in
<pb n="508" facs="tcp:43599:272"/>Heaven</hi> cannot (in any ſtrictneſs or propriety of ſpeaking) come under the notion of an <hi>oblation</hi> or <hi>Sacrifice.</hi> There indeed is the <hi>preſenting, commemorating, pleading</hi> of the Sacrifice which he offer'd here <hi>on earth,</hi> but that's all; he <hi>improves</hi> the <hi>Sacrifice</hi> there upon the <hi>Throne,</hi> but he made it here upon the <hi>Croſs;</hi> he <hi>ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>plys</hi> the expiation <hi>there</hi> but he <hi>wrought</hi> it <hi>here.</hi>
               </p>
               <p n="4">4. 'Tis true, the High Prieſt entred into the Sanctuary and there expiated ſin, but 'twas with the <hi>blood</hi> which had been ſhed and of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fered <hi>without:</hi> ſome of that <hi>blood</hi> (before offered upon the <hi>Prieſt's Altar</hi>) he carried into the Holy of Holy's, and there preſented it before the Lord, and ſo made atonement. Had he gone in thither <hi>without this blood</hi> and only have <hi>ſhown himſelf</hi> before God, it would have ſignified nothing; what he there did was grounded upon the virtue of the <hi>preceding oblation,</hi> which was only now in a more <hi>ſolemn manner</hi> repreſented before the Lord. Juſt ſo it is with our Lord Jeſus, he entred into Heaven and there <hi>intercedes</hi> as our <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> to his Father, but the <hi>efficacy</hi> of this his <hi>interceſſion</hi> is founded upon his <hi>blood</hi> ſhed when he was here <hi>on earth:</hi> take away <hi>his oblation here</hi> and take away his <hi>interceſſion there,</hi> for 'tis that which gives the <hi>efficacy</hi> and <hi>prevalency</hi> to this. Therefore he's ſaid <hi>to enter into the holy place,</hi> but how? why, <hi>by his own blood</hi> Heb. 9.11. he muſt firſt ſhed his blood here upon Earth, and then carry the <hi>virtue</hi> and <hi>merit</hi> of it with him into Heaven, and ſo he may expect to do ſomething (which upon his <hi>meer appearance</hi> in Heaven he could not have done). So that there muſt be ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thing in <hi>Chriſt's Prieſthood</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice</hi> more than what is proper to him now <hi>he is above,</hi> in correſpondency to what was done by the <hi>High-Prieſt</hi> in his entring into the Holy of Holy's and there expiating ſin. I think if all be put together which hath been ſpoken upon this account, the Truth (which I contend for) is written as with the beams of the Sun, therefore I'le ſay no more.</p>

How this is ſet forth by <hi>ſuch terms</hi> as anſwer to the <hi>Law-Sacrifices,</hi> I have already ſhown: Heb. 1.3. <hi>When he had by himſelf [purged] our ſins:</hi> 1 Joh. 1.7. <hi>and the blood of Jeſus Chriſt his Son [cleanſeth] us from all ſin:</hi> Rev. 1.5. <hi>

As namely the <hi>taking away of ſin;</hi> Joh. 1.29. <hi>Behold, the Lamb of God that taketh away the ſin of the world:</hi> 1 Joh. 3.5. <hi>And ye know that he was manifeſted to take away our ſins</hi>—: (which <hi>taking away of ſin</hi> was a thing far above the power of the <hi>Levitical Sacrifices,</hi> Heb. 10.4. <hi>For it is not poſſible that the blood of Bulls and of Goats ſhould take away ſins</hi>). So alſo the <hi>finiſhing</hi> and <hi>making an end</hi> of ſin; Dan. 9.24.—<hi>to finiſh the tranſgreſſion, and to make an end of ſins—:</hi> where the <hi>finiſhing of tranſgreſſion</hi> is not the <hi>filling</hi> up of its <hi>full meaſure</hi> (of which you reade Gen. 15.16. 1.

               <p>To clear up this whole matter I would lay down <hi>three things:</hi>
                  <list>
                     <item>1. When we ſay <hi>that the Law-Sacrifices did take off the guilt of all ſins,</hi> yea, of <hi>great ſins,</hi> we alwayes <hi>except ſuch as God himſelf did except;</hi> where he was pleas'd to make <hi>a limitation</hi> there we muſt do the ſame, but not otherwiſe.</item>
                     <item>2. 'Tis evident that <hi>as to ſome ſins God did make an exception.</hi> For the caſe ſtood thus;<note n="*" place="margin">See <hi>Grotius</hi> de Sat.

Here now was a <hi>limitation</hi> ſet by God himſelf, and therefore here could be <hi>no expiation</hi> (in the <hi>external</hi> and <hi>ordinary way</hi>): indeed upon <hi>repentance</hi> there might be the do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing away of the <hi>moral guilt</hi> (which made the offender <hi>lyable</hi> to <hi>God</hi> and to <hi>eternal death</hi>), but as to <hi>political guilt</hi> (which made the <hi>offender</hi> lyable to <hi>temporal death</hi>), that (if <hi>publick</hi> and <hi>known</hi>) could not by <hi>Sacrifices</hi> be taken off: when therefore you hear ſo much ſpoken of the <hi>virtue</hi> and <hi>efficacy</hi> of the <hi>old Sacrifices</hi> as <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>piatory,</hi> you muſt alwayes underſtand it according to <hi>this ſtating</hi> of it.</item>
                     <item>3. Thoſe Sacrifices may be conſidered <hi>abſolutely</hi> or <hi>rela<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tively: Abſolutely</hi> and <hi>in themſelves,</hi> and ſo their <hi>expiation</hi> reach<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed only to <hi>ſome ſins</hi> and to the removal of <hi>ſome guilt</hi> (viz. that which was <hi>ritual</hi> and <hi>ceremonial</hi>): <hi>Relatively</hi> with reſpect to <hi>Chriſt</hi> who was <hi>typified</hi> by them, and ſo by <hi>virtue</hi> of his <hi>great Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifice</hi> to come (which they <hi>prefigur'd</hi>) to perſons duly quali<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied their <hi>expiation</hi> was <hi>general</hi> of <hi>all ſins</hi> and of <hi>all guilt,</hi> (I mean of all <hi>moral guilt before God</hi> though not of all <hi>political guilt before Men</hi>).</item>

               <p>But though there be this difficuly as to the <hi>type,</hi> as to the <hi>anti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>type</hi> there's none: by Chriſt's offering up of himſelf to be ſure <hi>all ſins</hi> are <hi>expiated,</hi> even the <hi>greateſt</hi> are waſh'd away by his <hi>blood,</hi> none can ſtand before his <hi>infinite merit</hi> and <hi>ſatisfaction;</hi> former Sa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>crifices were <hi>weak</hi> but Chriſt the <hi>grand Sacrifice</hi> he is <hi>ſtrong,</hi>

                  <list>
                     <item>1. All along in Scripture the <hi>confirmation of the Doctrine of the Goſpel is laid upon Chriſt's Works and Miracles, not upon his Death:</hi>

               <p>And ſo 1. <hi>here's a Sacrifice for ſin.</hi> All men in <hi>ADAM</hi> having <hi>ſinned wilfully, after that they had receiv'd the knowledge of the truth,</hi> there might have been <hi>no Sacrifice for their ſin</hi> (to allude to that Heb. 10.26.); but the gracious God notwithſtanding all this was pleas'd to admit of <hi>a Sacrifice;</hi> yea, himſelf to <hi>find out</hi> and <hi>ordain</hi> that Sacrifice; here's matter of comfort.</p>
               <p n="2">2. <hi>Chriſt himſelf was this Sacrifice.</hi> And if ſo, how <hi>pleaſing</hi> muſt it needs be to God! Eph. 5.2.—<hi>and hath given himſelf for us, an offering and a Sacrifice to God for a ſweet-ſmelling ſavour:</hi> I tell you, there was infinitely more in this <hi>one Sacrifice</hi> to <hi>pleaſe</hi> God
<pb n="561" facs="tcp:43599:298"/>than there is in <hi>all your ſins</hi> (put them all together) to <hi>diſpleaſe</hi> God. If Chriſt be the Sacrifice, there muſt be an <hi>infinite efficacy</hi> and <hi>merit</hi> in it; from the <hi>dignity</hi> of his <hi>perſon</hi> an <hi>infiniteneſs</hi> of <hi>merit</hi> muſt needs reſult: if he will <hi>die</hi> and <hi>ſhed his blood</hi> what can be too high for you? ſurely too there's more in <hi>his Offering</hi> to <hi>ſave you</hi> than there is <hi>in Sin</hi> to <hi>damn you.</hi> If he be the Sacrifice, no queſtion but the Father did <hi>accept</hi> of it: and indeed of this he hath given <hi>ſufficient evidence</hi> to the world; not only by his carriage towards <hi>the Saints,</hi> but alſo (and chiefly) by his carriage to<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wards <hi>Chriſt himſelf:</hi> for whereas of old he was wont to <hi>teſtifie</hi> his <hi>acceptation</hi> of the <hi>Sacrifices,</hi> by <hi>conſuming them by fire from hea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ven.</hi> (Gen. 15.17. Levit. 9.24. Judg. 6.21. 2 Chron. 7.1.); here (with reſpect to <hi>Chriſt's Sacrifice</hi>) he teſtify'd his <hi>acceptance</hi> in an <hi>higher way,</hi> viz. by <hi>raiſing</hi> him from the <hi>dead, taking</hi> him up to <hi>heaven, re-admiting</hi> him into his <hi>preſence,</hi> and <hi>ſetting</hi> him at his Son, had he not been <hi>well-pleaſed</hi> with his <hi>perſon</hi> and <hi>oblation?</hi> Oh there's a <hi>convincing evidence</hi> of this in <hi>his going to the Father,</hi> Joh. 16.8, 10. By this Sacrifice (thus accepted) you are <hi>made perfect,</hi> (as you have often heard out of Heb. 10.14, 18.); there's nothing now to be done by <hi>Chriſt</hi> or by <hi>you,</hi> but only to <hi>apply</hi> and <hi>improve</hi> what he hath already done: is not this ground of ſtrong conſolation? And know further (for your comfort), that the <hi>vertue</hi> of <hi>Chriſt's Offering</hi> is as great <hi>now</hi> as it was at the <hi>firſt;</hi> his blood is as <hi>effectual</hi> with God for your good <hi>now</hi> as it was when it was juſt running warm from his veins, and<note n="*" place="margin">Adeò mag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num eſt hoc Sacrificium, ut quamvis u<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>num ſit &amp; ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mel oblatum, ſufficiat ad aeternitatem, <hi>Anſelm.</hi>
                  </note> ſo it ſhall be to the end of the world.

O no! as God was <hi>juſt</hi> to <hi>puniſh</hi> it <hi>once</hi> ſo he is <hi>gracious</hi> (and <hi>juſt</hi> too) not to puniſh it <hi>twice.</hi> What this <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demning of ſin</hi> is you have heard: if you follow <hi>the word</hi> the com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort lies thus, a <hi>condemnatory Sentence</hi> is by God upon Chriſt's ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>count paſs'd upon it, he hath <hi>adjudg'd</hi> it to <hi>die</hi> for all the <hi>miſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chiefes</hi>

If you leave the <hi>Word</hi> and come to the <hi>main import</hi> of it, then the comfort lies thus; the <hi>guilt</hi> of all <hi>your ſins</hi> is <hi>fully</hi> done away and <hi>expiated</hi> by <hi>Chriſt's Sacrifice;</hi> this <hi>Lamb of God</hi> (as offered) hath taken it all away; his <hi>blood hath cleanſed</hi> you from <hi>all ſin;</hi> your <hi>Scape-goat</hi> hath carried all your iniquities into the <hi>land of forgetfulneſs.</hi> Oh your <hi>guilt</hi> was charg'd <hi>upon Chriſt,</hi> and it ſhall not be charg'd <hi>upon you</hi> too; you are to <hi>mourn</hi> over it, but yet know he hath <hi>fully ſatisfied</hi> for it: what would you have more?

                        </list>
The <hi>paſſive O<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bedience</hi> ſatisfies as to the <hi>Laws penalty</hi> and ſecures from the <hi>Laws curſe,</hi> but where's our performing of the <hi>Duty</hi> which the Law requires if the <hi>active Obedience</hi> be not imputed alſo? And 'tis conceived, that this <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> doth <hi>mainly</hi> and <hi>primarily</hi> refer to the <hi>preceptive</hi> and <hi>mandatory</hi> part of the Law, and but <hi>ſecondarily</hi> to the <hi>penal</hi> and <hi>minatory</hi> part of the Law: For in all Laws (<hi>Civil</hi> or <hi>Sacred.</hi>) that which is <hi>firſt intended</hi> in them is <hi>active Obedience;</hi> the bearing the <hi>penalty</hi> is annexed but to <hi>further</hi> and <hi>ſecure</hi> that: ſo that he who only bears the <hi>penalty</hi> doth not anſwer the <hi>firſt end</hi> and the <hi>main intention</hi> of the Law.

               <p>The <hi>Obſervation</hi> which lies plainly before us from theſe words is this; That <hi>all ſuch who have Chriſt's righteouſneſs imputed to them; they are not fleſhly but ſpiritual walkers;</hi> they do not live the <hi>car<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nal</hi> and <hi>ſinful</hi> but the <hi>holy</hi> and the <hi>heavenly life.</hi> Or thus, <hi>None can warrantably pretend to an intereſt in Chriſt's Obedience</hi> (<hi>active</hi> or <hi>paſſive</hi>), <hi>but only ſuch who in their courſe are acted by the Spirit, and not by the Fleſh.</hi> But I ſhall not ſay any thing upon <hi>this Point;</hi> both becauſe this <hi>walking</hi> not after <hi>the fleſh</hi> but after <hi>the Spirit</hi> hath been already fully opened; and alſo becauſe as to the <hi>in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſeparable connexion</hi> bewixt this <hi>imputation</hi> and <hi>this converſation,</hi> I may hereafter have occaſion to ſpeak more conveniently to it when I ſhall have more room for it than here I have.</p>
               <p>I will cloſe all with a <hi>brief Survey</hi> of <hi>the Verſes</hi> which I have gone over, that we may the better underſtand the Apoſtle's <hi>method</hi> in them, and alſo what <hi>progreſs</hi> we have made in the thing which he is upon.</p>
               <p>He firſt layes down his <hi>main foundation,</hi> in <hi>this Propoſition<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> There is no condemnation to them who are in Chriſt Jeſus,</hi> (Verſ. 1.): Then he <hi>amplifies</hi> himſelf about <hi>this Propoſition;</hi> where (1.) <hi>He cha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>racteriſes the proper Subject of the priviledge</hi> (viz. of <hi>non-condemna<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion</hi>), [who <hi>walk not after the fleſh but after the Spirit</hi>]: this only he names in the general <hi>Verſ.</hi> 1. and 4: but then <hi>Verſ.</hi> 5. he falls upon a more <hi>full</hi> and <hi>particular illuſtration</hi> of it, which he <hi>con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tinues</hi> in <hi>ſeveral Verſes.</hi> The <hi>Second</hi> thing he doth about <hi>the Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition</hi> is to <hi>prove</hi> the truth of <hi>the Praedicate;</hi> that there is <hi>no con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demnation</hi>
                  <pb n="622" facs="tcp:43599:329"/>&amp;c. And this he doth by <hi>theſe mediums;</hi> 
                  <q>They who are freed by the <hi>regenerating Spirit</hi> from the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Sin,</hi> and by <hi>Chriſt's death</hi> and <hi>Sacrifice</hi> from the <hi>guilt</hi> of <hi>Sin;</hi> as alſo who have <hi>Chriſt's full Obedience</hi> and <hi>Satisfaction</hi> of the <hi>Law imputed</hi> to them; to them there is <hi>no condemnation:</hi> But thus it is with all <hi>in Chriſt Jeſus;</hi> by the <hi>Law of the Spirit of Life in Chriſt</hi> they are <hi>freed from the Law of ſin and death,</hi> (there's deliverance from the <hi>power</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi>); God by <hi>Chriſt's</hi> being <hi>a Sacrifice</hi> hath <hi>condemned Sin</hi> (there's deliverance from the <hi>guilt</hi> of <hi>Sin</hi>); and the <hi>righteouſneſs</hi> of the <hi>Law</hi> is <hi>fulfilled in them</hi> (there's <hi>Chriſt's Obedience imputed to them</hi>); upon all this it muſt needs follow that <hi>to them there is no condemnation,</hi> (which was the thing to be proved).</q>
               </p>
               <p>Now theſe being things of <hi>great weight</hi> and <hi>importance,</hi> where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>in the very <hi>vitals</hi> and <hi>Spirit</hi> of the Goſpel do lie, the due and di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtinct opening of them (with <hi>other Truths interwoven</hi> in the words), hath made <hi>this Volume</hi> grow to a far <hi>greater bigneſs</hi> than what I expected. Wherein I have been <hi>unneceſſarily prolix</hi> I humbly begge the <hi>Readers</hi> pardon; but truly in ſpeaking to the Saints <hi>exemption from Condemnation,</hi> the <hi>myſtical <g ref="char:V">Ʋ</g>nion</hi> of Believers <hi>with Chriſt,</hi> the <hi>Spiritual Life,</hi> the <hi>Spirits agency</hi> in <hi>freeing</hi> Souls from the <hi>bondage of Sin,</hi> the <hi>Laws inability</hi> to <hi>juſtifie</hi> and <hi>ſave,</hi> Chriſt's <hi>Miſſion, eternal Sonſhip, Sacrifice, active fulfilling the Law</hi> &amp;c. I ſay in theſe <hi>weighty</hi> and <hi>fundamental points</hi> (ſo little un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood by the moſt, ſo much oppugned by Some,) I thought I could ſcarce ſay too much. Yet if ſuch who are judicious ſhall tell me this is a fault, I'le endeavour to mend it in what ſhall fol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>low; wiſhing that I could as eaſily mend other faults as that. Well! I have begun, and having ſo done I purpoſe (with God's grace and leave) to go on till I ſhall come to the end of this <hi>ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent Chapter:</hi> with <hi>this proviſo,</hi> if I may have ſome encourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment that theſe paſt labours may (in ſome meaſure) be uſeful and profitable: without that, why ſhould I proceed to trouble others and my ſelf too? The good Lord give a bleſſing to what is done and aſſiſt in what is yet further to be done.</p>
